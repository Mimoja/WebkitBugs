Reviewed by Kent Tamura.

Source/WebCore:

isHTMLContentElement() assumes that the content element always has
a tag name "content" but it doesn't when Shadow DOM feature is
disabled. This fix let the function see the correct tag name.

Test: fast/dom/shadow/insertion-points-with-shadow-disabled.html

* html/shadow/HTMLContentElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLContentElement::contentTagName):
* html/shadow/HTMLContentElement.h:
(HTMLContentElement):
(WebCore::isHTMLContentElement):
