Source/WebCore:

Fixing a TextTrackCue use after free bug. textTrackRemoveCues() needs to be called when
an HTMLTrackElement is removed from an HTMLMediaElement so that references to
TextTrackCues are removed from m_cueTree.

Test: media/track/track-remove-by-setting-innerHTML.html

* html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::willRemoveTrack):

LayoutTests:

* media/track/track-remove-by-setting-innerHTML-expected.txt: Added.
* media/track/track-remove-by-setting-innerHTML.html: Added.
