Crash due to column span under button element
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101402

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

When there is a column-spanning child of a RenderButton
splitBlocks() must split the RenderButton as well as its
only permitted direct child, the anonymous block referenced
by m_inner. A crash was occurring because splitBlocks()
calls addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks() to add the
cloned m_inner to the cloned RenderButton, which meant the
m_inner for the cloned RenderButton was not being set even
though a child was being added. This violates state
assumptions in the RenderButton code.

This patch prevents any descendants of RenderButton from
spanning columns. Also, it adds a precautionary check in
RenderButton::removeChild() to mitigate problems if similar
state problems are found in future.
