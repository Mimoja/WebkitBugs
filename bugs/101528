Crash in WebCore::RenderLayer::normalFlowList
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101528

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Make sure the layout is up to date before re-computing the caret rect.
Avoid doing the layout when the selection is cleared since we can always stop
the blink timer in that case.

Unfortunately, we haven't found any reproduction of this crash yet.
