Use-after-free in media player handling
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103426

Patch by Aaron Colwell <acolwell@chromium.org> on 2012-11-27
Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

Source/WebCore:

Fixed use-after-free bugs caused by the MediaSource not being closed before the HTMLMediaElement or the MediaPlayer
is destroyed. Closing the MediaSource causes it to clear its reference to the MediaPlayer which prevents
the use-after-free problems from happening.

Test: http/tests/media/media-source/video-media-source-closed-on-htmlmediaelement-destruction.html

* html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::~HTMLMediaElement):
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::clearMediaPlayer):

LayoutTests:

- Added a test to verify that the MediaSource gets closed when the HTMLMediaElement is destroyed
  after it is removed from the DOM.
- Updated video-media-source-state-changes-expected.txt to reflect a slight change in event dispatch ordering.
