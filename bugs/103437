[BlackBerry] http:// origins can navigate to privileged local:// origins

Patch by Jacky Jiang  <zhajiang@rim.com>.
Reviewed by Yong Li.

PR: 251489
When we aren't allowed to display the destination origin, we shouldn't
even create the window for it. In this way we can block the remote
origins(like http://) window.open local origins(like file:// and
local://) and avoid further security issues.
Chrome and Safari will open a blank window and fail to load. Firefox
will fail to open the window and report a load failure error which has
the same behavior as us. I would prefer this way as the window would
be useless and the calls after that would be harmful to us.
