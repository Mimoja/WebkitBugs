<rdar://problem/12645085> REGRESSION (r130851): With kerning enabled, a white-space: pre-wrap inline starting with tab+space has the wrong width
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103541

Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

Source/WebCore: 

Test: fast/text/tab-with-kerning.html

When kerning is enabled, words are measured with their trailing space, then the width of a
space is subtracted. The logic to do this was incorrectly being invoked even when the
trailing whitespace character was a tab or a newline.

* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::LineBreaker::nextLineBreak): Changed to check only for the space
character, not other space-like characters.

LayoutTests: 

* fast/text/tab-with-kerning-expected.html: Added.
* fast/text/tab-with-kerning.html: Added.
