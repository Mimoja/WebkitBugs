XSSAuditor bypass with script src=data: URL ending in <!--
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103548

Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

This fixes an additional case where characters from the page itself are
included with the snippet to match against the reflected vector, and the
JS remains legitimate because of a <!--- comment. Truncate the snippet at
such a comment.

Test: http/tests/security/xssAuditor/script-tag-with-source-data-url3.html

* html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp:
(WebCore::XSSAuditor::decodedSnippetForAttribute):

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/script-tag-with-source-data-url3-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/script-tag-with-source-data-url3.html: Added.
