[BlackBerry] window.open can load url twice which can cause security and timing issues

PR: 252234
When we call window.open() in JS, DOMWindow will create a window and
change the url to load the resources. However, during the window
creation, we dispatch an OpenWindow event with the url to browser side
and browser side loads the url thereafter as well.
DOMWindow::createWindow() is only required to create the window not to
load url as far as I can tell. This is unneccessary and can cause
unexpected issues. So just pass an empty url instead to avoid
the double-load issue.
