Do not reuse ExclusionShapeInsideInfo in a recursive region layout
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114467

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

Elements that respect shape-inside that have inline children should not reuse an
ExclusionShapeInsideInfo for their children's layout. This patch adds the test
for regions. See the details for non-region layout in bug 104582.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104582

Test: fast/regions/shape-inside/shape-inside-recursive-layout.html

* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::layoutExclusionShapeInsideInfo): Do not look up a region's
ExclusionShapeInsideInfo if a block is already respecting shape-inside.

LayoutTests:

Test that for various types of inline containers do not reuse
ExclusionShapeInsideInfo when laying out their children.
