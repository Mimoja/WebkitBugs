[CSSRegions] Pseudo-elements should not be directly collected into a named flow
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105046

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

Prevent pseudo-elements to be collected into a named-flow by bailing out early in the collecting stage.
Following the CSSRegions spec, http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-regions/#flow-into, the pseudo-elements
like ::before/::after/::first-letter/::first-line are not allowed to become content nodes, being directly
collected into a flow thread.
