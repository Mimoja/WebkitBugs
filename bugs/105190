[GTK] Login & password shown in browsers' URL entry after successful HTTP authentication

Source/WebCore:

Test: http/tests/misc/authentication-redirect-4/authentication-sent-to-redirect-same-origin-url.html

* platform/network/soup/ResourceHandleSoup.cpp:
(WebCore::restartedCallback): After sending a redirect with credentials to libsoup, strip
the credentials from the request. This ensures that the credentials do not show up in
the user agent or in document.location.

LayoutTests:

Add a new test that checks that the URL of a page that redirects and uses
authentication. This verifies correct behavior for ports that communicates
a request's credentials to the platform networking layer by setting them in the URL.
The credentials should not remain in the URL string itself.
