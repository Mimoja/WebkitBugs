ShadowRoot.getElementById() returns a deleted element
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105243

Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

Source/WebCore:

Only when the treeScope of an element and the treeScope of insertionPoint is the same in insertedInto or removedFrom,
we can call updatedId() etc. However, we didn't check it's same.

For removedFrom, since an element has been removed, treeScope() doesn't return the original treeScope but document()
every time.

This patch might hurt html5-full-render a bit: the result is here. The first 2 results are without this patch,
the last 2 results are with this patch.
