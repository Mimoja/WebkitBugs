Crash caused by incomplete cleanup of regions information for anonymous block
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106191

Patch by Andrei Bucur <abucur@adobe.com> on 2013-01-14
Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

When an anonymous block is no longer required it is removed from the render tree and deleted. For example, this can happen when an anonymous block children change
from inlines to blocks. The patch updates the removeLeftoverAnonymousBlock function to delete the flow thread information attached to the obsolete anonymous block.
The removeFromRenderFlowThread() function is recursive and it needs to be called after the anonymous block children were reparented and the child list cleared.
I've also placed the children reset operation before clearing the parent because the latter also deletes the inRenderFlowThread flag from the object and it makes
flow thread ownership detection impossible.
