Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

Always walk up from beforeChild until the parent() is the owner of the
child list, otherwise we can end up in situations where
newChild->parent() == owner but newChild->nextSibling()->parent() != owner
which is a recipe for security bugs. Previously we only walked up through
anonymous blocks, but missed anonymous inline blocks like those generated
by <ruby>.

Test: fast/css-generated-content/bug-106384.html

* rendering/RenderObjectChildList.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObjectChildList::insertChildNode):

LayoutTests:

Add a test for <ruby> and generated content causing asserts and
crashes.
