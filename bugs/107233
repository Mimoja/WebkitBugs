[Shadow DOM] Selecting a node to another node in ShadowDOM fires 'click' event unexpectedly
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107233

Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

Source/WebCore:

When selecting from a node to another node in ShadowDOM, 'click' event is unexpectedly fired.

The root cause of the bug is using shadow ancestor nodes for checking the node mouse is pressed on
and the node mouse is released on is the same. This was introduced to fire a click event for a slider
in <input> or etc.

However, we don't need to check shadow ancestor if we're in Author ShadowDOM.
