document.referrer leakage with XSS Auditor page block
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109089

Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

Pass "about:blank" as referrer instead of "" so that the actual page
is not leaked when empty referrers are replaced later on in the
request.

* html/parser/XSSAuditorDelegate.cpp:
(WebCore::XSSAuditorDelegate::didBlockScript):

LayoutTests:

Test prints the referrer to show it isn't leaked.
