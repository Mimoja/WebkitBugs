ASSERT(!renderer()->needsLayout()) when calling Element::focus() with generated content

Test: fast/css-generated-content/quote-layout-focus-crash.html

In some cases RenderQuote may mark itself and containing blocks as needing layout
during a layout, but then one of it's containing blocks will mark itself as having
finished layout so the RenderQuote and potentially some of it's ancestor renderers
needLayout(), but the ancestors above those do not.

Until we have proper pre-layout tasks we should just walk the list of quotes
right before layout and mark all their ancestors as needing layout if the quote
needs layout.
