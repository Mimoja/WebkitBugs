Assertion failure, !node || node->isElementNode(), in
WebCore::RenderBlock::clone()
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110489>
<rdar://problem/13666425>

Source/WebCore:

We're ending up in RenderBlock::splitBlocks() with |this| ==
|fromBlock|.  We then try to climb the ancestor block chain from
this->parent() to |fromBlock|, but this->parent() is already above
|fromBlock|, so we end up climbing up to the RenderView and trying to
clone it, causing the assertion failure.

Adopt Chromium's mitigation for this from
<https://codereview.chromium.org/13852041>. This is not intended as a
fix for the underlying issue.

Also, fix another issue that occurs with this fuzzed test case that's
not handled by the Chromium fix.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::splitBlocks):
Ensure while we're in the loop that |curr| is a descendant of
|fromBlock|. From the Chromium patch:

    We need to check in every iteration of the loop because
    moveChildrenTo could have moved |curr|. This is a mitigation and
    not really a fix against a class of tree craziness.

Finally, before moving children from |fromBlock| to |toBlock|, ensure
that the children are children of |fromBlock|. If we never entered the
loop, they will be siblings of |fromBlock|, not children.
