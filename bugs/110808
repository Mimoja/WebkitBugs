Parsing of HTML tags in MathML Text Insertion Points leads to bogus parser behavior
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110808

Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

When looking for various table tags in the HTMLElementStack, compare
QualifiedNames rather than just local names, where necessary.

Note that not all uses have been "fixed"; I've only changed for which
I could write a test with differing behavior. A followup patch to
rationalize the use of QualifiedName vs local names would be ideal.

Tests: html5lib/generated/run-math-data.html
       html5lib/generated/run-math-write.html

* html/parser/HTMLElementStack.cpp:
(WebCore::inScopeCommon): Added a version of inScopeCommon that
handles QualifiedNames instead of just localNames.
(WebCore::HTMLElementStack::inTableScope): When given a QualifiedName,
call the new version of inScopeCommon().
* html/parser/HTMLTreeBuilder.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLTreeBuilder::processStartTag):
(WebCore::HTMLTreeBuilder::processEndTagForInTableBody):
(WebCore::HTMLTreeBuilder::processTrEndTagForInRow):
