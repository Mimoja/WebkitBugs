XSSAuditor should strip formaction attributes from input and button elements.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110975

Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

Source/WebCore:

The 'formaction' attribute of 'input' and 'button' elements is just as
dangerous as the 'action' attribute of 'form' elements. This patch
teaches the XSSAuditor how to avoid them.

Tests: http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-button.html
       http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-input.html

* html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp:
(WebCore::XSSAuditor::filterStartToken):
(WebCore::XSSAuditor::filterInputToken): Added.
(WebCore::XSSAuditor::filterButtonToken): Added.
* html/parser/XSSAuditor.h:
    Create filters for 'input' and 'button' elements, which currently
    only have the effect of filtering the 'formaction' attribute.

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-button-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-button.html: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-input-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/formaction-on-input.html: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl:
    Support 'showFormaction' as a new option to write out formaction values.
