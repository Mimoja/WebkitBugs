XSSAuditor should strip dangerous attributes from SMIL animation elements.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111071

Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

SMIL animation elements can, amusingly enough, animate the 'href' of a
link. This patch teaches XSSAuditor how to deal with the
semicolon-separated 'animation[values]' attribute in order to ensure
that it doesn't contain JavaScript URLs that could be animated into
place for an unsuspecting user to click on.

Test: http/tests/security/xssAuditor/svg-animate.html

* html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp:
(WebCore::isSemicolonSeparatedAttribute): Added.
    This returns true if the given attribute is SVGNames::valuesAttr,
    but makes it possible to easily extend the list with additional
    attributes with this strange property.
(WebCore::semicolonSeparatedValueContainsJavaScriptURL): Added.
    Given a semicolon-separated string, determine if it contains any
    JavaScript URLs.
(WebCore::XSSAuditor::eraseDangerousAttributesIfInjected):
    When looking for dangerousness, determine whether or not we should
    be comparing against each member of a semicolon-separated list.

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl:
    Add a new mode that dumps an element and its attributes, which is a
    bit more robust than adding a new mode for each attribute type we're
    interested in.
