WebSpeech: Crash in WebCore::PlatformSpeechSynthesisUtterance::client / WebCore::SpeechSynthesis::didResumeSpeaking
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112728

Reviewed by Tim Horton.

When cancel() is called, there was a delay in the platform returning and saying speech was finished, which caused
the m_currentSpeechUtterance variable to get deallocated but not cleared. 

This patch fixes up the management of the utterances in SpeechSynthesis and the Mac platform given that
we can't rely on the platform to return immediately on a stop speaking job.
