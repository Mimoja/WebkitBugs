SVGCSSParser: m_implicitShorthand value is not reset after adding the shorthand property
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116470

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore:

When we encounter a shorthand css property, we set m_implicitShorthand
to true to tell addProperty() later that the individual properties are
all set through a short hand one. We need to make sure that setting 
m_implicitShorthand to true will not be leaked after finishing parsing
the short hand property.

Test: fast/css/implicit-property-restore.html

* css/parser/CSSParser.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSParser::parseValue):
(WebCore::CSSParser::parseFillShorthand):
(WebCore::CSSParser::parseShorthand):
(WebCore::CSSParser::parse4Values):
(WebCore::CSSParser::parseBorderRadius):
(WTF::ImplicitScope::ImplicitScope): Deleted.
(WTF::ImplicitScope::~ImplicitScope): Deleted.
Get rid of ImplicitScope and replace its calls by TemporaryChange<bool>.
        
* css/parser/SVGCSSParser.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSParser::parseSVGValue):
Restore m_implicitShorthand value after setting it temporarily to true.

Source/WTF:

* wtf/TemporaryChange.h:
(WTF::TemporaryChange::TemporaryChange):
Add a new constructor to make TemporaryChange work as a restorer. The
temporary change will happen after we construct the object.

LayoutTests:

* fast/css/implicit-property-restore-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/css/implicit-property-restore.html: Added.

* fast/css/remove-shorthand-expected.txt:
Rebase-line the test expected results because of fixing the leak of
m_implicitShorthand. The bug was happening because "background: ..." property
comes immediately before the "list-style: ...." property.
