Source/WebCore:

Ported from a Blink patch by kenrb@chromium.org:

Clear floats on RenderBlocks that haven't had layout

WebKit revision 150084 creates a condition where a RenderBlock
can have a populated floating object list even when it has not
previously had layout. Since clearing of floats is optimized
to not search through parts of the tree that have not had layout,
references to floating objects were not being cleared in some cases.

This patch causes markAllDescendantsWithFloatsForLayout() to proceed
in the above case, in order to clear floats for a RenderBlock that has
not had layout.

Test for crash. Note that this will only crash when run under a memory
checking tool like ASAN.
