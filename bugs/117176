Assertion failure in WebCore::FlexBoxIterator::next()
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117176>
<rdar://problem/14054549>

Source/WebCore:

Code added in r115687 began removing anonymous wrappers when children
become inline. However, there are some objects, like
RenderDeprecatedFlexBox, whose children should always be blocks.

Reviewed by Tim Horton.

* rendering/RenderBlock.h:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::canCollapseAnonymousBlockChild):
Made public.

* rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObject::removeAnonymousWrappersForInlinesIfNecessary):
Return early if we can't collapse anonymous block children.
