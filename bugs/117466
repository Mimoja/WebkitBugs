If an event is created using as target an HTMLMediaElement which is
currently being deleted it becomes a heap-use-after free situation.

The GenericEventQueue instance is already owned by the HTMLMediaElement,
and there already is an underlying mechanism to set the target of the
event to NULL, if their target is owner of the queue.

In order to avoid creating this reference in the first place, we enqueue
the event with a NULL target to defer the refcount increment until the
timer for dispatching the event happens (which won't happen at all if
garbage collection is already destroying the objects).

Source/WebCore: 

Test: media/track/media-element-enqueue-event-crash.html

* dom/GenericEventQueue.cpp:
(WebCore::GenericEventQueue::enqueueEvent): Don't ASSERT if the event has no target.

* html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::~HTMLMediaElement): Close the event queue so it won't try to
    dispatch any pending events.
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::scheduleEvent): Don't set the event target, it will happen just
    prior to event dispatch.
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::stop): Close the event queue.

LayoutTests: 

* media/track/media-element-enqueue-event-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* media/track/media-element-enqueue-event-crash.html: Added.
