Fix crash due to unexpected Node deletion during MutationObserver registration book-keeping
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119124

Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

Merge https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/b6afb927695b3acf2c75c25f05e99682660993e2

No new tests since I could not reproduce the crash with the test attached in the Blink change.

The bug was caused by Node::unregisterMutationObserver removing the MutationObserverRegistration
that holds the last ref to the node. Avoid that by explicitly allocating a local RefPtr to the node
in MutationObserverRegistration::unregister. Also rename it to unregisterAndDelete to clarify
the semantics and make it a static member function to be even safer.
