[CSSRegions] Unable to collect html element in a named flow
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121878

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Source/WebCore:

Tests: fast/regions/collect-html-in-named-flow.html
       fast/regions/iframe-html-collected.html

It should be possible to collect the html element in a named flow.
However, before we check whether adding a child is not restricted
by its original parent, we have to make sure that the original parent
is an element to safely perform the check.

* rendering/RenderNamedFlowThread.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderNamedFlowThread::isChildAllowed):

LayoutTests:

Use an iframe with a html element collected in a named flow
to test that is does not crash or assert.
