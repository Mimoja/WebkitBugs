In some situations, partial layouts of floating elements produce incorrect results.

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

When performing partial layout of float elements and checking if other float
elements are encountered, incorrect results were obtained by not checking
the size of the existing floats vector.

Test: fast/block/float/floats-in-clean-line-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::checkFloatsInCleanLine):

LayoutTests:

Added test to ensure an assertion is not reached when performing a partial
layout of float elements in certain situations.

* fast/block/float/floats-in-clean-line-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/block/float/floats-in-clean-line-crash.html: Added.
