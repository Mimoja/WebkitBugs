Add more assertions with security implications in DocumentOrderedMap
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124559

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Assert that newly added elements and existing elements in the document ordered map are in the same tree scope
as the document ordered map. Also exit early if we're about to add an element in a wrong document to the map.
We don't exit early in get() because the damage has already been done at that point (the element may have been
deleted already).

* dom/Document.cpp:
(WebCore::Document::addImageElementByLowercasedUsemap):
* dom/DocumentOrderedMap.cpp:
(WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::add): Assert that the newly added element is in the current tree scope.
Also exit early if either the element is not in the tree scope or not in the right document.
While this doesn't make the function completely fault safe, it'll catch when we try to add a detached node.
(WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::remove): Convert existing assertions to ones with security implication.
(WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::get): Assert with security implication that the element we're about to return
is in the current tree scope. The element may have already been deleted if we ever hit these assertions.
(WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::getAllElementsById):  Convert an existing assertion to an assertion with security
implication.
* dom/DocumentOrderedMap.h:
* dom/TreeScope.cpp:
(WebCore::TreeScope::addElementById):
(WebCore::TreeScope::addElementByName):
(WebCore::TreeScope::addImageMap):
(WebCore::TreeScope::addLabel):
* html/HTMLDocument.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLDocument::addDocumentNamedItem):
(WebCore::HTMLDocument::addWindowNamedItem):
* html/HTMLImageElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLImageElement::insertedInto): Set InTreeScope flag before calling addImageElementByLowercasedUsemap.
* html/HTMLMapElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMapElement::insertedInto): Ditto for addImageMap.
