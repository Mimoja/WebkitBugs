Update style in FrameSelection instead of RenderView's member functions. These are the last two
member functions of RenderView that updates the style.

* editing/FrameSelection.cpp:
(WebCore::FrameSelection::focusedOrActiveStateChanged):
(WebCore::FrameSelection::bounds):
* rendering/RenderView.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderView::selectionBounds):
(WebCore::RenderView::repaintSelection):
