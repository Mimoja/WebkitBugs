Improve "bad parent" and "bad child list" assertions in line boxes
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125656

Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

My previous fix for this problem was incomplete. This continuation of that fix addresses
the flaw in the original and adds additional lifetime checking so problems can be seen in
debug builds without a memory debugger.

* rendering/InlineBox.cpp:
(WebCore::InlineBox::assertNotDeleted): Added. Poor man's memory debugging helper.
(WebCore::InlineBox::~InlineBox): Refactored body into a new function named
invalidateParentChildList. Added code to update the deletion sentinel to record
that this object is deleted.
(WebCore::InlineBox::setHasBadParent): Moved here from header since this debug-only
feature does not need to be inlined. Added a call to assertNotDeleted.
(WebCore::InlineBox::invalidateParentChildList): Added. Refactored from the destructor,
this is used by RenderTextLineBoxes.

* rendering/InlineBox.h: Added the deletion sentinel, and called it in the parent
function. Also changed the expansion/setExpansion functions to use the type name "int",
since we don't use the type name "signed" in the WebKit coding style.

* rendering/InlineFlowBox.cpp:
(WebCore::InlineFlowBox::~InlineFlowBox): Call setHasBadChildList rather than doing the
setHasBadParent work on children directly, to avoid code duplication.
(WebCore::InlineFlowBox::setHasBadChildList): Moved here from header. Added code to set
"has bad parent" on all children, something we previously did only on destruction. Also
added assertNotDeleted.
(WebCore::InlineFlowBox::checkConsistency): Added call to assertNotDeleted. Also tweaked
code style and variable names a little bit.

* rendering/InlineFlowBox.h: Moved setHasBadChildList out of the header when it's on.
The empty version for ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION_DISABLED is still in the header.

* rendering/RenderTextLineBoxes.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderTextLineBoxes::invalidateParentChildLists): Call the new
InlineBox::invalidateParentChildList function instead of calling setHasBadChildList directly.
The new function checks m_hasBadParent, something we couldn't do here.
