Crash in CSSImageGeneratorValue and RenderScrollbar
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125702

Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

Source/WebCore:

This crash had two causes at two different levels. The crash fixes both.

At the RenderScrollbar level, we were setting up a new renderer, a
RenderScrollbarPart, and never calling initializeStyle. This meant that
we did not do proper style setup, which meant we did not end up calling
CSSImageGeneratorValue::addClient and so had a removeClient that was not
properly balanced by an addClient. This is the primary bug.

At the CSSImageGeneratorValue level, the addClient and removeClient
functions were not properly handling possibly-mismatched calls. It was
easy to fix the functions to work even if the calls are not perfectly
matched up, which makes the consequences of a missed addClient call
much less dire, no longer messing up reference counting. Fixing this
mitigates the risk if we made this same mistake elsewhere, although I
could not find any other places with some quick searches.

Test: fast/css/scrollbar-image-crash.html

* css/CSSImageGeneratorValue.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSImageGeneratorValue::addClient): Only call ref if this will
add the first client.
(WebCore::CSSImageGeneratorValue::removeClient): Only call deref if this
removes the last client. Also added an assertion that can fire if we call
removeClient without first calling addClient, which is illegal. However,
the function handles that case without over-deref'ing itself.

* rendering/RenderScrollbar.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderScrollbar::updateScrollbarPart): Simplify the logic for
needRenderer a bit. Use initializeStyle rather than setStyle when first
creating the RenderScrollbarPart. Also use add and take properly so we
don't do extra hash lookups the old code did with get/set and get/remove.

LayoutTests:

* fast/css/scrollbar-image-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/css/scrollbar-image-crash.html: Added.
