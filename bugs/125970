Crash in WebCore::LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches::LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125970

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Source/WebCore: 

The bug was caused by containingBlockForAbsolutePosition returning a non-RenderBlock render object.
Fixed the bug by obtaining its containg block.

Also changed the return type of containingBlockForFixedPosition, containingBlockForAbsolutePosition,
containingBlockForObjectInFlow from RenderElement to RenderBlock as all callers of these functions
had assumed the return value to be an instance of RenderBlock.

Test: svg/text/select-text-inside-non-static-position.html

* rendering/LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches.h:
(WebCore::containingBlockForFixedPosition):
(WebCore::containingBlockForAbsolutePosition):
(WebCore::containingBlockForObjectInFlow):
(WebCore::LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches::LogicalSelectionOffsetCaches):

LayoutTests: 

Added a regression test.

* svg/text/select-text-inside-non-static-position-expected.txt: Added.
* svg/text/select-text-inside-non-static-position.html: Added.
