Don't set document.domain to an IP address fragment

Source/WebCore:

This patch matches the following Blink one:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink//b19a57fdb323d5a80d3a1cb0a6b343558c4237b0

IP address octets should not be treated as subdomains when setting
document.domain. The specs say:
'The domain attribute's setter must run these steps: ...
7. If host is not equal to effectiveDomain, then run these substeps:
    1. If host or effectiveDomain is not a domain, then throw a
    "SecurityError" DOMException.'

'A host is a domain, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address.'

Test: http/tests/security/set-domain-remove-subdomain-for-ip-address.html

* dom/Document.cpp:
(WebCore::Document::setDomain):
    Now checks whether the security origin is allowed to remove
    subdomains. If not, it throws a security error.
* page/OriginAccessEntry.cpp:
(WebCore::OriginAccessEntry::OriginAccessEntry):
    Constructor now expects an IP address setting.
(WebCore::OriginAccessEntry::matchesOrigin):
    Now also checks whether the host in an IP address and returns
    false if IP addresses aren't configured to be treated as domains.
* page/OriginAccessEntry.h:
    Introduced new enum for IP address setting.
    Constructor now expects an IP address setting.
(WebCore::OriginAccessEntry::ipAddressSettings):
    New getter.
(WebCore::operator==):
    Now also requires IP address settings to match.
* page/SecurityPolicy.cpp:
(WebCore::SecurityPolicy::addOriginAccessWhitelistEntry):
    Changes to match OriginAccessEntry's new constructor.
(WebCore::SecurityPolicy::removeOriginAccessWhitelistEntry):
    Changes to match OriginAccessEntry's new constructor.
* page/Settings.in:
    Added a setting to allow IP address octets to be treated as
    subdomains. This way our existing tests setting document.domain
    still work.

LayoutTests:

IP address octets should not be treated as subdomains when setting document.domain.

* http/tests/security/aboutBlank/security-context-alias.html:
    Now enables the new setting treatIPAddressesAsDomains.
