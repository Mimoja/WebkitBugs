Crash when merging ruby bases that contain floats

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=127515
<rdar://problem/15896562>

Source/WebCore:

This crash occurs when we remove a ruby text object and decide to merge
two adjacent ruby base objects. The right ruby base's children were
being merged into the left ruby base, but the right ruby base's floats
were not being moved to the left base. This could cause us not to
descend into all nodes containing a FloatingObject in
RenderBlockFlow::markAllDescendantsWithFloatsForLayout(), because we
assume that if a block does not have a particular float in its float
list, none of its descendants will, either.

* rendering/RenderBlockFlow.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::moveFloatsTo):
Code split out of moveAllChildrenIncludingFloatsTo().
(WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::moveAllChildrenIncludingFloatsTo):
Call moveFloatsTo().

* rendering/RenderBlockFlow.h:
Add declaration of moveFloatsTo().

* rendering/RenderRubyBase.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderRubyBase::mergeChildrenWithBase):
Move children and floats to the new base.

* rendering/RenderRubyBase.h:
Declare mergeChildrenWithBase().

* rendering/RenderRubyRun.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderRubyRun::removeChild):
Call mergeChildrenWithBase().
