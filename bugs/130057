Continuations casting issue.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130057
<rdar://problem/16283406>

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore: 

The code to update relative positioned anonymous block continuations should not
have assumed that all siblings were RenderBlocks. Make the code smarter and
make it bail when it hits something that isn't part of the block continuation
chain.

Added fast/block/continuation-crash.html

* rendering/RenderInline.cpp:
(WebCore::updateStyleOfAnonymousBlockContinuations):

LayoutTests: 

* fast/block/continuation-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/block/continuation-crash.html: Added.
