Mutating rules returned by getMatchedCSSRules can result in crash

The non-standard getMatchedCSSRules API returns CSSStyleRule objects that don't
have parent stylesheet pointer (as we don't know which sheet the rule originated from).
Mutating the rule via such wrapper can lead to crashes later as we fail to invalidate
the underlying stylesheet.
        
Fix by disallowing mutation of style rules that don't have parent sheet pointer. CSSStyleRule
has two mutable properties selectorText and style. The latter gives back CSSStyleDeclaration.
This patch disallows mutations in both cases for CSSStyleRules that don't have parent stylesheet
pointer.
        
While it is technically possible to have CSSRules that are legitimately disconnected
from stylesheet (by removing rule from sheet while holding a reference to it) it never
makes sense to mutate such rule as there is no way to do anything with it afterwards.

    Bail out if parent stylesheet is null.

    Allow StyleRuleCSSStyleDeclaration subclass cancel the mutation via
    boolean return value from willMutate.

(WebCore::StyleRuleCSSStyleDeclaration::willMutate):
        
    Disallow mutation if the owning CSSStyleRule is null or has null stylesheet.

(WebCore::StyleRuleCSSStyleDeclaration::didMutate):
        
    We never get here with null rule or stylesheet anymore.
