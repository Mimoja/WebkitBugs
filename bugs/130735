[CSSRegions] Displaying region's children in another region not supported
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130735

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

With http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/166353, we disabled the possibility
of collecting the region's children into another flow and displaying them
in another region.
I added a new test for this and also changed the plain ASSERT in Element dtor
to ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION to better reflect the meaning of the assertion.

Test: fast/regions/region-child-not-flowed.html

* dom/Element.cpp:
(WebCore::Element::~Element):

LayoutTests:

With http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/166353, we disabled the possibility
of collecting the region's children into another flow and displaying them
in another region. With that change, we also skipped the existing tests.

Add a dedicated test that passes if a region child cannot be painted in another region,
in order to complete the skipped tests. This test should be removed when support for
this functionality will be added again.

* fast/regions/region-child-not-flowed-expected.html: Added.
* fast/regions/region-child-not-flowed.html: Added.
