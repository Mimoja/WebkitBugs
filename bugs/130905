Clear sibling floats while splitting inline flow
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130905

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

This is a port of a Blink patch by kenrb@chromium.org.
(https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=169658&view=revision)

During RenderInline::splitFlow(), floats are cleared on an anonymous
containingBlock() for the inline being split. This is a problem if
siblings of the block contain references to the same floats, since the
float removal code in markSiblingsWithFloatsForLayout() will not later
find them.

This change also affects RenderBlock::splitFlow() and
RenderBoxModelObject::moveChildrenTo, since those are called in
similar situations as RenderInline::splitFlow().

Test: fast/block/float/split-inline-sibling-of-float-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBlockFlow.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::removeFloatingObjects): Add call to
    markSiblingsWithFloatsForLayout() before removing floats.

LayoutTests:

This test will only crash if run with Address Sanitizer or some other
address checking tool.
