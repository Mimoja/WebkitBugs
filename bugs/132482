Various assertion failures occur when executing script in the midst of DOM insertion
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132482

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Source/WebCore:

Prior to this change, when an element containing a <script> child was inserted into a document, the script was
executed in ScriptElement::insertedInto(). That script can access nodes that follow it in the newly-inserted
hierarchy but are not yet fully inserted, leading to at least the following problems:

    - The script could remove a node that is not yet marked as in the document.
    - The script could remove a named <map> that has yet to be added to TreeScope::m_imageMapsByName.
    - The script could remove a form control that has yet to be added to FormController::m_formElementsWithState.

These scenarios all result in assertion failures. This change ensures that each node in the newly-inserted
hierarchy is fully inserted before executing any scripts.

* dom/ScriptElement.cpp:
(WebCore::ScriptElement::shouldNotifySubtreeInsertions): Renamed from insertedInto().
Returned true in the case where insertedInto() would've called prepareScript().
(WebCore::ScriptElement::didNotifySubtreeInsertions): Called prepareScript().
(WebCore::ScriptElement::insertedInto): Renamed to shouldNotifySubtreeInsertions().
* dom/ScriptElement.h:
* html/HTMLScriptElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLScriptElement::insertedInto): If shouldNotifySubtreeInsertions() is true, returned InsertionShouldCallDidNotifySubtreeInsertions.
Otherwise, returned InsertionDone.
(WebCore::HTMLScriptElement::didNotifySubtreeInsertions): Called ScriptElement::didNotifySubtreeInsertions().
* html/HTMLScriptElement.h:
* svg/SVGScriptElement.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGScriptElement::insertedInto): Did the same as HTMLScriptElement::insertedInto().
(WebCore::SVGScriptElement::didNotifySubtreeInsertions): Called ScriptElement::didNotifySubtreeInsertions().
* svg/SVGScriptElement.h:

LayoutTests:

Wrote named-map-removed-while-inserting-parent-crash.html by reducing the test case attached to bug 132482.
The remaining tests were taken from blink r132482.
