REGRESSION (r167652): SelectionState is not set properly for non leaf objects in pages with regions
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132493

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:
Non selection leaf elements were not included in the selection ranges,
that was causing that their selection state was not set properly and
when one of the element was removed as it was marked as SelectionNone
current selection was not removed.

Due to this fix, the regression detected in bug #131982 arose again.
Reverted changes from r167675 and reopened bug as previous fix was not
right. Updated TestExpectations accordingly.

Test: fast/regions/selection/crash-select-all.html

* rendering/RenderView.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderView::splitSelectionBetweenSubtrees): We need to include
non selection leafs in the range, otherwise we won't be marking
selection state of some elements properly.

LayoutTests:
* TestExpectations: Marked
fast/regions/cssom/region-range-for-box-crash.html as crashing on
debug due to regression detected in bug #131982.
* fast/regions/selection/crash-select-all-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/regions/selection/crash-select-all.html: Added.
