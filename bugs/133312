Inline continuation code should not take anonymous containing wrapper granted.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133312

Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

It's wrong to assume that when RenderInline is part of an inline continuation, its containing block
is an anonymous wrapper and its sibling might be a block level renderer.
When the inline continuation is no longer needed, for example when the block level renderer that initiated the continuation
is detached from the render tree, the inline renderes still continue to form continuation.(however they no longer require
anonymous wrappers)
