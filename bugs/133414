[CSS Shapes] Image lifetime is not properly handled for gradient shapes
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133414

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore:
Refactor computedShape() and it's helpers to be able to properly
manage the lifetime of the image returned from StyleImage.

This is a port of a Blink patch by Hans Muller.

Test: fast/shapes/shape-outside-floats/shape-outside-uncached-gradient.html

* rendering/shapes/ShapeOutsideInfo.cpp:
(WebCore::ShapeOutsideInfo::createShapeForImage): Properly handle the
    lifetime of the image. Changed to use StyleImage::image() to get
    the image in all cases there's no need to special case cached
    images.
(WebCore::ShapeOutsideInfo::computedShape): Call createShapeForImage.
(WebCore::getShapeImageAndRect): Deleted.
* rendering/shapes/ShapeOutsideInfo.h:

LayoutTests:
* fast/shapes/shape-outside-floats/shape-outside-uncached-gradient-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/shapes/shape-outside-floats/shape-outside-uncached-gradient.html: Added.
