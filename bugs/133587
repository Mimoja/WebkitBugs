REGRESSION (r168046): Incorrect handling of object information in WebCore::RenderFlowThread::removeLineRegionInfo
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133587

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

When an object flowed in multicol is moved from in-flow positioning to out-of-flow positioning,
its information must be removed from the flowthread prior to the change being made.
Otherwise, the flow thread will no longer be its containing block and a reference to it
will not be possible to obtain.

No new tests can be added because the code still hits in an unrelated assertion followed by a null dereference.
The issue was discussed with Antti Koivisto and we decided its better to fix this problem first and
handle the following issue in a separate bug.

* rendering/RenderBlockFlow.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::styleWillChange):
* rendering/RenderObject.h:
(WebCore::RenderObject::flowThreadContainingBlock):
