REGRESSION (r168046): Confused column spans when combined with dynamic animations
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134048.

Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

Source/WebCore:

Added fast/multicol/multicol-fieldset-span-changes.html

* rendering/RenderMultiColumnFlowThread.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderMultiColumnFlowThread::processPossibleSpannerDescendant):
Refactor handling of insertions into the multicolumn flow thread into
a helper function, processPossibleSpannerDescendant. This makes it easier
to call the code from more than one place.

(WebCore::RenderMultiColumnFlowThread::flowThreadDescendantInserted):
Modify the nested columns span shifting code to avoid problems. The
new code suppresses notifications and does the move of the spanner back
into the original spot *before* removing the placeholder. This ensures that
the placeholder parent still exists.
        
The stale placeholder is then removed and destroyed after the spanner has been put back
into place.

(WebCore::RenderMultiColumnFlowThread::handleSpannerRemoval):
(WebCore::RenderMultiColumnFlowThread::flowThreadRelativeWillBeRemoved):
Refactor the removal notifications for spanners into a helper function so that it can
be called to do cleanup from the code that cleans up stale placeholders on a shift.

* rendering/RenderMultiColumnFlowThread.h:
Modified to add the new helpers.

LayoutTests:

* fast/multicol/multicol-fieldset-span-changes-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/multicol/multicol-fieldset-span-changes.html: Added.
