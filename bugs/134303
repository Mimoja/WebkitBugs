REGRESSION (r169105): Crash in selection
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134303

Patch by Radu Stavila <stavila@adobe.com> on 2014-07-28

Source/WebCore:

When splitting the selection between different subtrees, all subtrees must have their selection cleared before
starting to apply the new selection. Otherwise, when selecting objects in a named flow thread and going up
its containing block chain, we can end up in the view's selection root, which has not yet been updated and so
we get inconsistent data.

To achieve this goal, the selection update was split into a "clear" and an "apply" method. The updateSelectionForSubtrees
method first iterates through all subtrees and performs the "clear" method and then starts all over again
and performs the "apply" method.
