Crash when creating CSSCalcBinaryOperation

Source/WebCore:

Test: fast/css/calc-binary-operation-crash.html

* css/CSSCalculationValue.cpp:
(WebCore::determineCategory):

Ensure that both axis are within the addSubtractResult table.
Remove unneeded CalcOther test. The call site guarantees it doesn't happen and the normal cases would handle it anyway.
Also strengthen some asserts.

LayoutTests:

* fast/css/calc-binary-operation-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/css/calc-binary-operation-crash.html: Added.
