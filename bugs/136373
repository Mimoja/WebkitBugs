REGRESSION (r168921): SVG elements may be unnecessarily rebuilt
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136373

Reviewed by David Kilzer.

Source/WebCore:

Fixes an issue where a SVG element may be unnecessarily rebuilt. In particular,
it is unnecessary to rebuild a SVG element that will be removed from the document.

Test: svg/custom/remove-subtree-including-use-with-child-textpath-that-references-earlier-path.html

* svg/SVGDocumentExtensions.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGDocumentExtensions::removeAllElementReferencesForTarget): Modified to remove a SVG element
from the list of elements to be rebuilt.

LayoutTests:

Add a test to ensure that we don't rebuild a SVG element that will be removed from the document.

* svg/custom/remove-subtree-including-use-with-child-textpath-that-references-earlier-path-expected.txt: Added.
* svg/custom/remove-subtree-including-use-with-child-textpath-that-references-earlier-path.html: Added.
