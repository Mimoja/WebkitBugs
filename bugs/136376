ASSERT in RenderMultiColumnSet::requiresBalancing.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136376.

Reviewed by David Kilzer.

Source/WebCore:

Added fast/multicol/multicol-selection.html.

* rendering/RenderMultiColumnFlowThread.cpp:
(WebCore::isValidColumnSpanner):
Don't allow an object to become a spanner if it does not have the flow
thread as its containing block. Otherwise the flow thread won't get notified
of spanner placeholder insertions, and so the spanner ends up orphaned.

LayoutTests:

* fast/multicol/multicol-selection-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/multicol/multicol-selection.html: Added.
