Source/WebCore:
Scroll snap properties don't handle inherit and initial propertly.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=136643

Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

Restructured scroll snap code both to handle inherit and initial, and to reduce the
total code size a bit, fixing a few minor bugs along the way. Updated the regression
tests to cover the new parts.

* css/CSSComputedStyleDeclaration.cpp:
(WebCore::addValuesForNamedGridLinesAtIndex): Use a modern for loop.
(WebCore::scrollSnapDestination): Changed to take a LengthSize. Also streamlined.
(WebCore::scrollSnapPoints): Changed to to take a ScrollSnapPoints. Also streamlined and
added code to handle the "uses elements" case; serialize that as an identifier, not the
string "elements", fixing a minor bug.
(WebCore::scrollSnapCoordinates): Changed to take a Vector<LengthSize>. Also streamlined
and added code to handle the empty vector case; serialize that as an identifier, not the
string "none", fixing a minor bug.
(WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::getFontSizeCSSValuePreferringKeyword): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::counterToCSSValue): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::styledNode): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::propertyValue): Use nullptr. Moved CSS_SCROLL_SNAP
to a more appropriate section of the switch statement. Made it just call through to
the functions above in a more straightforward way.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyValue): Reversed logic to use early
return and to call emptyString.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::item): Use emptyString.
(WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::getCSSPropertyValuesForSidesShorthand): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::parentRule): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyCSSValue): Use nullptr.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyPriority): Use emptyString.
(WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyShorthand): Use emptyString.

* css/DeprecatedStyleBuilder.cpp:
(WebCore::ApplyPropertyMarqueeIncrement::applyValue): Use the switch statement for the
invalid value as well as for the valid values, rather than a separate if statement.
Call convertToLength directly rather than through a StyleResolver static member function.

* css/PropertySetCSSStyleDeclaration.cpp:
(WebCore::PropertySetCSSStyleDeclaration::getPropertyValue): Fixed a formatting mistake.

* css/StyleResolver.cpp:
(WebCore::convertToIntLength): Made this function local to this file instead of a
static member function.
(WebCore::convertToFloatLength): Ditto.
(WebCore::StyleResolver::parseSnapCoordinate): Added. Used to keep snap point parsing
code small.
(WebCore::StyleResolver::parseSnapCoordinatePair): Ditto.
(WebCore::StyleResolver::parseSnapPoints): Added. Parses an entire snap points property.
(WebCore::StyleResolver::applyProperty): Removed various bits of redundant code that
were not using the primitiveValue value already in a local variable. Added the
HANDLE_INHERIT_AND_INITIAL to all the scroll snap properties and updated since the
RenderStyle structure now more closely matches the CSS properties.

* css/StyleResolver.h: Updated for above changes, and removed a redundant "private:".

* page/scrolling/AxisScrollSnapOffsets.cpp:
(WebCore::appendChildSnapOffsets): Use auto& instead of SnapCoordinate since that type
is now gone. Updated since coordinates are now LengthSize.
(WebCore::updateFromStyle): Changed to take a reference instead of a pointer and
also to fetch the data from RenderStyle in a new way that more closely matches the
CSS properties.
(WebCore::updateSnapOffsetsForScrollableArea): Ditto. Also moved some memory allocation
inside if statements so we don't wastefully allocate and destroy.

* rendering/style/RenderStyle.cpp: Added an include of StyleScrollSnapPoints.h now
that the header doesn't include them. Moved the conditional includes out of the main
include paragraph (even though I don't think conditional includes are usually a good
idea).
(WebCore::RenderStyle::initialScrollSnapPointsX): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::initialScrollSnapPointsY): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::initialScrollSnapDestination): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::initialScrollSnapCoordinates): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::scrollSnapPointsX): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::scrollSnapPointsY): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::scrollSnapDestination): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::scrollSnapCoordinates): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::setScrollSnapPointsX): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::setScrollSnapPointsY): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::setScrollSnapDestination): Added.
(WebCore::RenderStyle::setScrollSnapCoordinates): Added.

* rendering/style/RenderStyle.h: Replaced the include of StyleScrollSnapPoints.h with
a forward declaration of ScrollSnapPoints. Removed getters and setters for the old
style properties and replaced them with new ones that match the CSS properties more
closely. Tweaked formatting a bit. Added initial value functions for the the scroll snap
properties.

* rendering/style/StyleRareNonInheritedData.cpp: Added include of StyleScrollSnapPoints.h
now that RenderStyle.h doesn't include it.
(WebCore::StyleRareNonInheritedData::StyleRareNonInheritedData): Updated since
m_scrollSnapType is now unsigned instead of ScrollSnapType.

* rendering/style/StyleRareNonInheritedData.h: Fixed type of m_scrollSnapType to be
unsigned instead of ScrollSnapType. This should have been causing problems on Windows,
but I think we got lucky and had no detectable problems.

* rendering/style/StyleScrollSnapPoints.cpp:
(WebCore::ScrollSnapPoints::ScrollSnapPoints): Added.
(WebCore::operator==): Added overloads for both ScrollSnapPoints and also for
StyleScrollSnapPoints; using a free function for both since both have public data.
(WebCore::defaultScrollSnapDestination): Added, replaces a static member function.
(WebCore::StyleScrollSnapPoints::StyleScrollSnapPoints): Updated both the default
constructor and the copy constructor for the new design.

* rendering/style/StyleScrollSnapPoints.h: Added a ScrollSnapPoints struct for the
type of the snap-points-x and snap-points-y CSS properties. Changed the data members
of StyleScrollSnapPoints to match the various CSS properties rather than breaking
out all the data into separate data members.
(WebCore::StyleScrollSnapPoints::defaultRepeatOffset): Deleted. Replaced by the
default constructor for ScrollSnapPoints.
(WebCore::StyleScrollSnapPoints::defaultDestinationOffset): Deleted. Replaced by
a function inside the .cpp file.

LayoutTests:
Scroll snap properties do not handle inherit and initial properly.

* css3/scroll-snap/scroll-snap-property-computed-style-expected.txt: Added
expected passing results from new tests.
* css3/scroll-snap/scroll-snap-property-computed-style.js: Added new test
cases that cover inherit and initial. Before, these would crash or fail.

passing results from new tests, and also updated to expect pass rather than
fail for the tests that had incorrect expected results.

* css3/scroll-snap/scroll-snap-property-parsing.js: Added new test cases that
cover inherit and initial. Also updated expected results for certain pixel
repeat cases that were incorrect.

* platform/mac/TestExpectations: Fixed an unrelated syntax error in this file.
