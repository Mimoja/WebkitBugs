REGRESSION (r173801): Use after free in WebCore::NotificationCenter::~NotificationCenter
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137163

Reviewed by Andy Estes.

Source/WebCore:

Test: fast/notifications/request-notification-permission-while-reloading.html

The test doesn't crash under WebKit2, but that's still OK for our purposes.

* Modules/notifications/NotificationCenter.cpp:
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::NotificationCenter): Initialize m_timer.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::createNotification): Moved here from the header.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::requestPermission): Start the timer and ref the notification
center when we need to defer a callback. Also use a lambda for the callback and changed
the argument to match what the bindings actually pass. Before we said PassRefPtr, but the
bindings were not transferring ownership of the VoidCallback. The new type is a little
strange but it's consistent with how the bindings work right now.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::timerFired): Added. Calls all the callbacks, then does a deref
to match the ref we did above.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::requestTimedOut): Deleted.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::NotificationRequestCallback::createAndStartTimer): Deleted.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::NotificationRequestCallback::NotificationRequestCallback): Deleted.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::NotificationRequestCallback::startTimer): Deleted.
(WebCore::NotificationCenter::NotificationRequestCallback::timerFired): Deleted.

* Modules/notifications/NotificationCenter.h: Reorganized the header to be a bit more tidy.
Changed the argument type for requestPermission to match the reality of what's passed by the
bindings. Removed NotificationRequestCallback and replaced the m_callbacks HashSet with a
vector of std::function.
