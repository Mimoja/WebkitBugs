REGRESSION (r174025): Invalid cast in JSC::asString
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137224

Store barrier elision in fixup depends on checking the type of the value being stored. It's very important that
when we speak of "the value being stored" we are really referring to the right value.
        
The bug here was that the PutClosureVar case was assuming that child2 is the value being stored. It's actually
child3. So we were incorrectly removing all barriers from PutClosureVar.
