SVG loaded through html <img> can't request to load any external resources.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=137762.

Patch by Said Abou-Hallawa <sabouhallawa@apple.com> on 2014-10-22
Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

Source/WebCore:

SVG images have unique security rules that prevent them from loading any external
resources. This patch enforces these rules in CachedResourceLoader::canRequest for
all non-data-uri resources.

The fix and the tests are ported but modified a little from the chromium fix:
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=rev&rev=176084

Test: http/tests/security/svg-image-with-cached-remote-image.html
      http/tests/security/svg-image-with-css-cross-domain.html

For the SVG image, prevent loading any external sub-resource except for data urls.
* loader/cache/CachedResourceLoader.cpp:
(WebCore::CachedResourceLoader::canRequest):

LayoutTests:

Ensure that SVG images, which are loaded through the <img> tag or through the
CSS background image, cannot load any external sub-resource except for data-
URL resources (though this doesn't work at the time of writing, see bug #137941).
Also ensure the same rule is enforced on cached resources.

The tests are ported but modified a little from the chromium fix:
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=rev&rev=176084
