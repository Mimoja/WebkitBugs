Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

This patch ensures that we clean up RenderNamedFlowFragment::m_renderObjectRegionStyle when embedded flow content is getting destroyed.

In m_renderObjectRegionStyle hash map, we store style information about the named flow's descendant children.
When a child is being detached from the tree, it removes itself from this hashmap.
We do it by traversing up on the ancestor chain and call removeFlowChildInfo() on the parent flow.
However in case of embedded flows (for example multicolumn content inside a region), we need to check whether the parent flow
is inside a flow too and continue the cleanup accordingly.
