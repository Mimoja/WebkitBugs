Do not destroy RenderQuote's text fragment child when quotation mark string is changing.

Similar approach as https://codereview.chromium.org/679593004/

This patch ensures that laying out a RenderQuote does not force a sibling RenderQuote's
child renderer(RenderText) to be destroyed.
BreakingContext holds a pointer to the next renderer on the line (BreakingContext::m_nextObject).
While laying out the line, initiated by BreakingContext, placing the current renderer could end up destroying the "next" renderer.
This happens when the pseudo after quotation mark(RenderQuote) becomes floated, the sibling <q>'s pseudo
before text needs to be changed (from " to ') so that we don't end up with 2 sets of the same opening
strings.
The fix is to reuse the RenderTextFragment object instead of destroy/recreate it.
