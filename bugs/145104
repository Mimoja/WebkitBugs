Merged anonymous blocks should invalidate simple line layout path.

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

When anonymous blocks are merged together, it's not guaranteed that the final block can use simple line layout.
This patch ensures that the flow block, where the other block's content gets moved to, is no longer on simple line layout path.
Whether the final flow block ends up using inline boxes or simple line layout will be determined during the next layout.
