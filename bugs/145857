ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION in WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::getElementById
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145857
<rdar://problem/16798440>

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Source/WebCore:

Make sure Node::insertedInto() gets called on the inserted node and its
descendants after its insertion into the tree but *before*
ContainerNode::childrenChanged() is called on the parent node. This is
needed so that the descendants know they've been inserted into the tree
(and their InDocumentFlag flag gets set) before the parent node does
anything with them in childrenChanged().

In the case of <rdar://problem/16798440>, executing HTMLScriptElement's
childrenChanged() after appending a child to a script element was causing
the script to be executed. The script would call getElementBy() which
would traverse the DOM tree and find a matching Element in the newly
inserted subtree. However, the matching Element's InDocumentFlag flag was
not set yet because the element's insertedInto() method has not been called
yet at this point. This would cause us to hit an assertion as
DocumentOrderedMap::getElementById() is only supposed to return elements
that are in a Document.
