style.fontFamily accessor crashes on unstyled node created from DOMParser().parseFromString()

<rdar://problem/21864487>

Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

Source/WebCore:

Font CSS properties are a little special because they are used as indices into caches.
Normally, StyleResolver gives all nodes a default font family, so our cache works correctly.
However, if the document doesn't have a Settings object, StyleResolver wasn't doing this.
Documents created from DOMParser().parseFromString() don't have a Settings object.

Test: fast/text/crash-font-family-parsed.html

* css/StyleResolver.cpp:
(WebCore::StyleResolver::defaultStyleForElement):
(WebCore::StyleResolver::initializeFontStyle): Set a font family even if we don't have a
Settings object.

LayoutTests:

* fast/text/crash-font-family-parsed-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/text/crash-font-family-parsed.html: Added.
