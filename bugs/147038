REGRESSION (r169105): Do not assign a renderer to multiple selection subtrees.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147038
rdar://problem/21819351

Reviewed by David Kilzer.

A renderer should never be assigned to multiple selection subtrees. (Currently RenderObject maintains the last selection state.)
RenderView::applySubtreeSelection() loops from the start to the end of the selection to find renderers that are inside the selection.
However, in case of regions (when multiple selection roots are present) traversing the renderer tree by calling RenderObject::nextInPreOrder() could
end up going across selection roots.
This patch ensures that we assign renderers to a specific selection only when the current selection root and the renderer's selection root match.
