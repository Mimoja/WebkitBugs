* platform/network/ProtectionSpaceBase.h: (WebCore::ProtectionSpaceBase::isPasswordBased):
* platform/network/ProtectionSpaceBase.cpp: (WebCore::ProtectionSpaceBase::isPasswordBased):
Added. This is somewhat weak, as authentication schemes could change, but I couldn't find
any better way.

* platform/network/ResourceHandle.h:
* platform/network/cf/ResourceHandleCFNet.cpp:
(WebCore::ResourceHandle::didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge):
(WebCore::ResourceHandle::tryHandlePasswordBasedAuthentication):
* platform/network/mac/ResourceHandleMac.mm:
(WebCore::ResourceHandle::didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge):
(WebCore::ResourceHandle::tryHandlePasswordBasedAuthentication):
Factored out password handling, and made sure to not try that for server trust.
