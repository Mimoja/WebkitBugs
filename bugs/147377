[iOS] Crash when encountering characters whose natural font is one we can't look up
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147377
<rdar://problem/22022011>

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore:

These characters hit the complex text code path, where CoreText picks fonts
to use for each character. We then try to map these CoreText fonts back to
our own Font objects, and we assume (on iOS) that our own font search will
always return something.

On OS X, we do not have such an assumption, and we handle the case where it
does not hold. This method works on iOS as well, so the solution is to just
perform it on both OSes.
