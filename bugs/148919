ASSERT_WITH_SECURITY_IMPLICATION in WebCore::DocumentOrderedMap::get(); update form
association after subtree insertion
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=148919
<rdar://problem/21868036>

Patch by Daniel Bates <dabates@apple.com> on 2015-09-07
Reviewed by Andy Estes.

Source/WebCore:

Currently we update the form association of a form control upon insertion into
the document. Instead we should update the form association of a form control
after its containing subtree is inserted into the document to avoid an assertion
failure when the containing subtree has an element whose id is identical to both
the id of some other element in the document and the name of the form referenced
by the inserted form control.

* html/FormAssociatedElement.cpp:
(WebCore::FormAssociatedElement::insertedInto): Moved resetFormOwner() from here
to {HTMLFormControlElement, HTMLObjectElement}::finishedInsertingSubtree().
* html/HTMLFormControlElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::insertedInto): Return InsertionShouldCallFinishedInsertingSubtree
so that HTMLFormControlElement::finishedInsertingSubtree() is called.
(WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::finishedInsertingSubtree): Added; turn around and
call FormAssociatedElement::resetFormOwner().
* html/HTMLFormControlElement.h:
* html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLInputElement::insertedInto): Return InsertionShouldCallFinishedInsertingSubtree so
that HTMLInputElement::finishedInsertingSubtree() is called and move logic to update radio button
group from here...
(WebCore::HTMLInputElement::finishedInsertingSubtree): to here.
* html/HTMLInputElement.h:
* html/HTMLObjectElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::insertedInto): Return InsertionShouldCallFinishedInsertingSubtree so
that HTMLObjectElement::finishedInsertingSubtree() is called.
(WebCore::HTMLObjectElement::finishedInsertingSubtree): Added; turn around and
call FormAssociatedElement::resetFormOwner().
* html/HTMLObjectElement.h:
* html/HTMLSelectElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLSelectElement::insertedInto): Modified to return the result of
HTMLFormControlElementWithState::insertedInto(), which may schedule a callback after subtree
insertion.
* html/HTMLTextFormControlElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLTextFormControlElement::insertedInto): Ditto.

LayoutTests:

Add tests to ensure that updating the form association of a form control in a subtree
does not cause an assertion failure.
