Cyclic resources were not detected if the reference had deep containers
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149182

Reviewed by John Honeycutt.

Source/WebCore:

During our examination of the SVG rendering tree looking for cycles,
if a resource pointed to something that had a nested structure, and
one of the parent nodes in that structure was a container object
without resources itself, we were not looking into the children.

Test: svg/custom/pattern-content-cycle-w-resourceless-container.html

* rendering/svg/SVGResourcesCycleSolver.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGResourcesCycleSolver::resourceContainsCycles): We should still
check all children resources, but not exit early if there are none. Instead
we should recurse into any children.
(WebCore::SVGResourcesCycleSolver::resolveCycles): Changes to some debug
code that no longer compiled (it's still off by default, but at least
it will work now).

LayoutTests:

This test was ported from Blink. I believe it originally
came from:
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=351713
