REGRESSION(r150187): updateIdForTreeScope may not be called inside shadow trees
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149364

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Since the tree scope is set to that of Document's inside removeBetween when a node is removed from a shadow tree,
oldScope != &treeScope() was already true inside Element::removedFrom. This can introduce an inconsistency in
DocumentOrderedMap which could result in a crash. Fixed the bug by checking it against document(), which is the
behavior we had prior to r150187.

Also added a consistency check in DocumentOrderedMap to catch bugs like this.

No new tests. New assertions fail in existing tests without this fix.
