Element::focus() should acquire the ownership of Frame.

<rdar://problem/23136794>

Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

Source/WebCore:

The FrameSelection::setSelection method sometimes releases the last reference to a frame.
When this happens, the Element::updateFocusAppearance would attempt to use dereferenced memory.
Instead, we should ensure that the Frame lifetime is guaranteed to extend through the duration
of the method call.
