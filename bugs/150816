Regression(r191673): Crash in RunLoopTimer::schedule()
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=150816
<rdar://problem/23335285>

Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

The crash was happening when the RunLoopTimer would fire during the
call to RunLoopTimer::schedule(), which can happen because we are
calling schedule() from a background thread. In such case, the
timerFired() callback execution would cause |this| to get destroyed.

To avoid this issue, DecodingResultDispatcher is now ref-counted. The
object is ref'd while calling startTimer() so that the object cannot go
away during the execution of this method. Also, we explicitly ref the
object when starting the timer to keep the object alive until the
RunLoopTimer has fired, at which point we explicitely de-ref.

This should handle correctly the cases where the RunLoopTimer fires
during AND after the execution of startTimer().
