Do not insert positioned renderers to multiple gPositionedDescendantsMap.

rdar://problem/22229889

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

We insert positioned renderers into a static map (RenderBlock::gPositionedDescendantsMap) to keep track of them.
This static map is at block level. A particular absolute positioned object is added to its closest ancestor that
returns true for RenderElement::canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects().
canContainAbsolutelyPositionedObjects() returns true if the ancestor is either positioned or has transform.
If this container's style changes so that it's no longer positioned and it has no transform anymore,
we need to clear its static map of positioned objects (they'll get re-inserted to another ancestor at next layout).

This patch addresses the case when the renderer does not have transforms anymore.
