ASSERTION FAILED: !floatingObject->originatingLine() in WebCore::RenderBlockFlow::linkToEndLineIfNeeded
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153001

Reviewed by Dan Bernstein.

1. Float boxes are always attached to the line where we see them first.
2. Float box can only be attached to one line.
3. RenderBlockFlow can perform partial layout on dirty lines only.

In certain cases, the last dirty line can "pull up" float boxes from the first clean line.
It simply means that due to some layout changes on previous lines now we see those floats on this last dirty line first.
If after placing the float we still find it on the same position, the line below is still considered clean.
Source/WebCore:

Remove the float box from its original line if the line above already placed it.

Remove the float box from its original line if the line above already placed it.
