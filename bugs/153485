JSONObject Walker::walk must save array length before processing array elements.

Reviewed by Darin Adler and Michael Saboff.

Source/JavaScriptCore:

According to https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-internalizejsonproperty,
JSON.parse() should cache the length of an array and use the cached length when
iterating array elements (see section 24.3.1.1 2.b.iii).

* runtime/JSONObject.cpp:
(JSC::Walker::walk):
* tests/stress/JSON-parse-should-cache-array-lengths.js: Added.

LayoutTests:

* js/JSON-parse-reviver-expected.txt:
* js/script-tests/JSON-parse-reviver.js:
- Fixed a bug in arrayReviver() where it was setting the array length to 3,
  but was immediately returning a value from the reviver for index 3.  This
  effectively forces array.length to 4.  As a result, case 4 always failed
  silently, and case 5 never executed.
- Added tracking of cases visited by the revivers so that they can be verified.
