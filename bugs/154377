Source/JavaScriptCore:

In a scenario where we cache the __proto__ accessors in global variables, and
later explicitly invoke those accessors as functions, the spec for Function Calls
(see https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-function-calls) states that the function
ref value is of type Reference, and base of ref is an Environment Record.  Then,
it follows that the thisValue should be set to refEnv.WithBaseObject()
(see section 4.b.ii of 12.3.4.1 at
https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-function-calls-runtime-semantics-evaluation).

refEnv in this case is the environment record that the cached accessors were
found in i.e. the global object.  The WithBaseObject() of the global object is
undefined (see details about WithBaseObject at
https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-environment-records).

Hence, the __proto__ accessors should see a thisValue of undefined, and throw
TypeErrors.  See https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-get-object.prototype.__proto__,
https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-set-object.prototype.__proto__,
https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-toobject, and
https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-requireobjectcoercible.

In JSC's implementation, the callee needs to do a ToThis operation on the
incoming "this" argument in order to get the specified thisValue.  The
implementations of the __proto__ accessors were not doing this correctly.  This
has now been fixed.
