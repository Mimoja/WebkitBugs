When a PingHandle is destroyed, we should tell its client so that the client can clear the pointer it
holds to the element to avoid accidentally attempting to use deallocated memory.

The ResourceHandle's client member may be null after "didReceiveResponse" is called. We should confirm
the client is still valid after these calls.

* platform/network/DataURL.cpp:
(WebCore::handleDataURL): Check the client pointer before using it.
* platform/network/PingHandle.h:
(WebCore::PingHandle::~PingHandle): Notify the client we are being destroyed.
* platform/platform/network/ResourceHandle.h:
