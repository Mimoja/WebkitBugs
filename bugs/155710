showModalDialog code runs with “first window” set to wrong window
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155710

Source/WebCore:

Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

Test: http/tests/security/cross-origin-modal-dialog-base.html

* page/Chrome.cpp:
(WebCore::Chrome::runModal): Null out entryScope so that the "first window"
checks inside the modal dialog won't run in the context of the original window
that presented the dialog.

Test by John Wilander.
