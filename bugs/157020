GuardMalloc crash in WebCore::HTMLFrameElementBase::marginHeight() 
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157020
<rdar://problem/25148315>

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Calls to setIntegralAttribute triggers event handling code, which can cause
the underlying m_frameOwnerElement member to be deleted. We could clone this
object, but since we only want the width and height we should just read them
while we know the object is in a good state, then execute the potentially
mutating methods.

Tested by imported/blink/fast/dom/HTMLBodyElement/body-inserting-iframe-crash.html.

* html/HTMLBodyElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLBodyElement::insertedInto): Read margin width and height before
calling setIntegralAttribute.
