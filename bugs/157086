Stack overflow error for deeply nested classes.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=157086

Reviewed by Geoffrey Garen.

Changed the StructureStubClearingWatchpoint destructor to iteratively destruct
its chain of next StructureStubClearingWatchpoints instead of recursively doing
so.

The added deep-StructureStubClearingWatchpoint-destructor-recursion.js test
produces a crash before the fix is applied, but takes about 14 minutes to run.
Hence, it is skipped.

* bytecode/StructureStubClearingWatchpoint.cpp:
(JSC::StructureStubClearingWatchpoint::~StructureStubClearingWatchpoint):
* tests/stress/deep-StructureStubClearingWatchpoint-destructor-recursion.js: Added.
