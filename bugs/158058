[Unix] Potential buffer overrun of m_fileDescriptors in readBytesFromSocket of ConnectionUnix.cpp
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158058

Patch by Fujii Hironori <Hironori.Fujii@sony.com> on 2016-05-25
Reviewed by Carlos Garcia Campos.

Memcpy does not check the boundary of m_fileDescriptors in
readBytesFromSocket of ConnectionUnix.cpp.  This is not a problem
in normal cases, but in the case when Web process is hijacked and
malicious IPC packets were sent.  WTF::Vector already has two
members m_capacity and m_size.  There is no need to have a
separate member m_fileDescriptorsSize to remember the number of
remaining data.

* Platform/IPC/Connection.h: Remove members m_readBufferSize and
m_fileDescriptorsSize.
* Platform/IPC/unix/ConnectionUnix.cpp:
(IPC::Connection::platformInitialize): Removed initialization of
m_readBufferSize and m_fileDescriptorsSize.  Reserve initial
capacity for m_readBuffer and m_fileDescriptors.
(IPC::Connection::processMessage): Replace m_readBufferSize and
m_fileDescriptorsSize with m_readBuffer.size() and
m_fileDescriptors.size().  Use Vector::shrink() to reset the
number of remaining data in the buffers.
(IPC::readBytesFromSocket) : Change argument types to WTF::Vector
instead of pointers and sizes.
(IPC::Connection::readyReadHandler): Call new readBytesFromSocket
