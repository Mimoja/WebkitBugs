Patch by Darin Adler <darin@apple.com> on 2016-06-02
Reviewed by Daniel Bates.

* css/CSSGrammar.y.in: Added a destructor for calc_func_term. This presumably
fixes some memory leaks in error cases. Removed an assertion about not needing
a call to destroy that was far too limited. Tweaked formatting of the percentage
ase in the key production. Indented calc_func_term to make it consistent with
other productions nearby.

* css/CSSParserValues.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSParserValueList::~CSSParserValueList): Use a modern for loop.
(WebCore::CSSParserValueList::deleteValueAt): Deleted. Unused function, and also
would have resulted in a memory leak unless the code already extracted the value
from the list.
(WebCore::CSSParserValueList::extend): Properly transfer ownership from one value
list to the other by setting the unit to 0 in the donor.

* css/CSSParserValues.h: Removed unused deleteValueAt function.
