* platform/URL.cpp:
(WebCore::containsOnlyASCII):
    Moved up to enable usage in URL::setHost and URL::setHostAndPort.
(WebCore::appendEncodedHostname):
    Moved up to enable usage in URL::setHost and URL::setHostAndPort.
(WebCore::URL::setHost):
    Now disallows the colon character, does IDNA encoding, and uses StringBuilder.
(WebCore::URL::setHostAndPort):
    Now disallows multiple colons, disallows non-numeric ports, disallows the empty
    string, does IDNA encoding, and uses StringBuilder.
