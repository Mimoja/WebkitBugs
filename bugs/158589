Restrict HTTP/0.9 responses to default ports and cancel HTTP/0.9 resource loads if the document was loaded with another HTTP protocol

No new tests. Our layout test environment does not allow for headerless responses
nor does it allow you to set an explicit HTTP/0.9 status header in PHP. I have
manually tested this change with a Python socket setup doing both headerless and
HTTP/0.9 header tests for positive and negative cases.

* loader/DocumentLoader.cpp:
(WebCore::DocumentLoader::responseReceived):
    Cancel loads if the request was made to a non-default port.
* loader/ResourceLoader.cpp:
(WebCore::ResourceLoader::didReceiveResponse):
    Cancel loads if the request was made to a non-default port or if the document
    was loaded with another protocol. Cancelation is handled as a fail so as to
    fire the onerror event and allow sites to handle it gracefully.
