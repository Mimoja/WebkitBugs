Make sure HTTPHeaderMap gets a move constructor / assignment operator.
It was not getting an implicit one because of its user-declared
destructor. This patch drops the user-declared destructor so that
HTTPHeaderMap now gets an implicit move constructor / assignment
operator.

Not having a move constructor / assignment operator is an issue because
we rely on HTTPHeaderMap::isolatedCopy() / WTFMove() since r201623 to
pass HTTPHeaderMap across thread.
