Reviewed by Zalan Bujtas.
Source/WebCore:

If a scrolling state tree node changed type (e.g. from sticky to fixed), we'd fail
to recreate the node so keep a node with the wrong type.

Fix by destroying the node and making a new one with a new ID in this case. The
new ID is necessary to ensure that the scrolling tree is updated.
