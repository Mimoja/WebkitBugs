It should not be possible to access Location attributes cross origin

Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

Source/WebCore:

It should not be possible to access Location attributes cross origin:
- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#crossoriginproperties-(-o-)

We allow access to replace() as per the specification and consistently
with Firefox. The specification seems to indicate we should allow access
to 'href' but Firefox does not and we previously did not so I am not
allowing it in this patch.
