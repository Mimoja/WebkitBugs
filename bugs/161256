Avoid holding GlyphData in MathOperator
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161256
<rdar://problem/28033400>

Reviewed by Myles C. Maxfield.

Do not cache GlyphData in MathOperator elements, because the fonts referenced in the
GlyphData may be purged during low-memory conditions. Instead, we should store either
the relevant CodePoint, or the fallback Glyph (for the current system font).

Added an initialization function for GlyphAssemblyData, since unions containing structs
do not properly call constructors, resulting in garbage font/glyph content.

No new tests. Changes are covered by existing MathML test suite.

* rendering/mathml/MathOperator.cpp:
(WebCore::MathOperator::GlyphAssemblyData::initialize): Added.
(WebCore::MathOperator::MathOperator): Initialize m_assembly/m_variant.
(WebCore::MathOperator::setSizeVariant): Only store the glyph, not the font.
(WebCore::glyphDataForCodePointOrFallbackGlyph): Added helper function.
(WebCore::MathOperator::setGlyphAssembly): Do not rely on stored GlyphData.
(WebCore::MathOperator::calculateGlyphAssemblyFallback): Remove unneeded argument. Check
if a fallback glyph is being used and remember for later.
(WebCore::MathOperator::calculateStretchyData): Do not rely on stored GlyphData.
(WebCore::MathOperator::fillWithVerticalExtensionGlyph): Ditto.
(WebCore::MathOperator::fillWithHorizontalExtensionGlyph): Ditto.
(WebCore::MathOperator::paintVerticalGlyphAssembly): Ditto.
(WebCore::MathOperator::paintHorizontalGlyphAssembly): Ditto.
(WebCore::MathOperator::paint): Ditto.
* rendering/mathml/MathOperator.h:
(WebCore::MathOperator::GlyphAssemblyData::hasExtension): Added.
(WebCore::MathOperator::GlyphAssemblyData::hasMiddle): Added.
(WebCore::MathOperator::MathOperator): Deleted.
