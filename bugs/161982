REGRESSION (r205670): ASSERTION FAILED: methodTable(vm)->toThis(this, exec, NotStrictMode) == this
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=161982

Reviewed by Saam Barati.

Source/JavaScriptCore:

Update JSProxy::setPrototype() to return false unconditionally instead
of forwarding the call to its target. We used to forward to the target
and then the JSDOMWindow's [[SetPrototypeOf]] would return false.
However, the JSC tests use a different GlobalObject and forwarding
the setPrototypeOf() call to the GlobalObject lead to hitting an
assertion. This patch aligns the behavior of the GlobalObject used by
the JSC tests with JSDOMWindow.

* runtime/JSProxy.cpp:
(JSC::JSProxy::setPrototype):

Source/WebCore:

We no longer need a custom [[SetPrototypeOf]] anymore as JSProxy::setPrototypeOf()
no longer forwards the call to its target.

No new layout tests because the behavior only changes in the context of the JSC
tests (which were updated in this patch).

* bindings/js/JSDOMWindowCustom.cpp:
(WebCore::JSDOMWindow::setPrototype): Deleted.
* page/DOMWindow.idl:

LayoutTests:

Bring back JSC test coverage that got lost in r205670.
