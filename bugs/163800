Do not mutate the render tree while collecting selection repaint rects.

<rdar://problem/28806886>

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

RenderListItem not only mutates the tree while in layout but it also uses
the old descendant context to find the insertion point.
This patch strictly ensures that we only do it while in layout and never
in other cases such as collecting repaint rects.
This gets redundant when webkit.org/b/163789 is fixed.

Test: fast/lists/crash-when-list-marker-is-moved-during-selection.html

(WebCore::RenderListItem::insertOrMoveMarkerRendererIfNeeded):
