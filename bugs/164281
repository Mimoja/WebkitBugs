Reviewed by Andy Estes.

Source/WebCore:

If the page is torn down during a load, we can attempt to use a deallocated
(and nulled) document loader. Most places that use the "active document loader"
null-check it before using, but there was one place that did not. This patch
fixes that oversight.

Test: fast/dom/crash-with-bad-url.html

* loader/FrameLoader.cpp:
(WebCore::FrameLoader::loadURLIntoChildFrame): Check that the active document
loader is non-null before using.

LayoutTests:

* fast/dom/crash-with-bad-url-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/dom/crash-with-bad-url.html: Added.
