document.caretRangeFromPoint doesn't retarget the resultant Range correctly.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165146

Reviewed by Sam Weinig.

Source/WebCore:

The bug was caused by caretRangeFromPoint not retargeting the resultant Range correctly.
Namely, it's possible for RenderObject::positionForPoint to move across shadow boundary
even if node was identically equal to ancestorInThisScope(node).

Fixed the bug by directly retargeting the range's container node and its offset as done
for elementFromPoint in r206795.

Test: fast/shadow-dom/caret-range-from-point-in-shadow-tree.html

* dom/Document.cpp:
(WebCore::Document::caretRangeFromPoint):

LayoutTests:

Added a regression test for caretRangeFromPoint retargeting the result.

* fast/shadow-dom/caret-range-from-point-in-shadow-tree-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/shadow-dom/caret-range-from-point-in-shadow-tree.html: Added.
