Side effects while restting form elements
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165959
<rdar://problem/29705967>

Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

Source/WebCore:

JavaScript logic can run while resetting FormElement objects. This can
lead to unintended side-effets and other unwanted behavior. We should
protect these elements during the reset.

Test: fast/html/form-mutate.html

* html/HTMLFormElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLFormElement::HTMLFormElement): Switch to C++11 initialization.
(WebCore::HTMLFormElement::reset): Protect elements until the reset
operation is finished.
(WebCore::HTMLFormElement::resetAssociatedFormControlElements): Added to share
code with 'resumeFromDocument'.
(WebCore::HTMLFormElement::resumeFromDocument): Protect elements until the
reset operation is finished.

LayoutTests:

* fast/html/form-mutate-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/html/form-mutate.html: Added.
