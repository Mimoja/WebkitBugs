Protect MediaPlayer from being destroyed mid-load()
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=166976

Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

It's possible for a message sent by MediaPlayer to HTMLMediaElement to cause
MediaPlayer to be destroyed before MediaPlayer::load() completes. We have
previously protected against this same problem in HTMLMediaElement::loadResource()
by ref'ing at the beginning of the function and deref'ing on exit. To do the
same in MediaPlayer, it must become RefCounted.

To keep the same semantics about m_client in MediaPlayer (always available without
requiring a null-check), make a new static MediaPlayerClient object which can
replace the real (HTMLMediaElement) client when the MediaPlayer is invalidated.
