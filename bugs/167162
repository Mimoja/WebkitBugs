Crash under HTMLFormElement::registerFormElement()

Source/WebCore:

didMoveToNewDocument() was re-registering FormAttributeTargetObserver
even if the element's inDocument was not set yet. As a result, it was
possible for FormAssociatedElement::resetFormOwner() to be called
when the element was in the tree but with its inDocument still being
false (because insertedInto() has not been called yet). This could
end up calling HTMLFormElement::registerFormElement() even though
the element is still recognized as detached. This is an issue because
HTMLFormElement::m_associatedElements's order and its corresponding
indexes (m_associatedElementsBeforeIndex / m_associatedElementsAfterIndex)
rely on the position of the element with regards to the form element
(before / inside / after).

To address the issue, we now only register the FormAttributeTargetObserver
in didMoveToNewDocument() if the inDocument flag is set to true. This
is similar to what is done at other call sites of
resetFormAttributeTargetObserver(). We also ignore the form content
attribute in HTMLFormElement::formElementIndex() if the element is
not connected.

As per the HTML specification [1], the form content attribute is only
taken if the element is connected (i.e. inDocument flag is true).

Note that FormAssociatedElement::findAssociatedForm() was already
ignoring the form content attribute if the element is disconnected.

Test: fast/forms/registerFormElement-crash.html

* html/FormAssociatedElement.cpp:
(WebCore::FormAssociatedElement::didMoveToNewDocument):
Only call resetFormAttributeTargetObserver() if inDocument flag is set,
similarly to what is done at other call sites.

(WebCore::FormAssociatedElement::resetFormAttributeTargetObserver):
Add an assertion to make sure no one call this method on an element that
is not connected.

* html/HTMLFormElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLFormElement::formElementIndex):
Ignore the form content attribute if the element is not connected, as
per the HTML specification [1].

LayoutTests:

Add layout test coverage.

* fast/forms/registerFormElement-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/forms/registerFormElement-crash.html: Added.
