Crash under FormSubmission::create()
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167200
<rdar://problem/30096323>

Patch by Chris Dumez <cdumez@apple.com> on 2017-02-09
Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Source/WebCore:

The issue is that FormSubmission::create() was iterating over
form.associatedElements() as was calling Element::appendFormData()
in the loop. HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() was calling
pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::Load) which causes a synchronous
layout and can fire events (such as focus event) synchronously.
Firing those events synchronously allows the JS to modify the
form.associatedElements() vector we are currently iterating on.

To avoid this issue, we now call pluginWidget(PluginLoadingPolicy::DoNotLoad)
in HTMLObjectElement::appendFormData() as we are not allowed to fire
synchronous events at this point. I also added a security assertion
in FormSubmission::create() to catch cases where we fire JS events
while iterating over the form associated elements to more easily
notice these things in the future.
