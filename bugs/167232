Crash under DOMSelection::deleteFromDocument()
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167232

Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

Source/WebCore:

The crash was caused by DOMSelection's deleteFromDocument() mutating contents inside the user-agent
shadow tree of an input element when the text field is readonly. Fixed the bug by exiting early
whenever the selection is inside a shadow tree since getSelection().getRangeAt(0) always returns
a range outside the input element or any shadow tree for that matter.

New behavior matches that of Gecko. The working draft spec of which I'm the editor states that
deleteFromDocument() must invoke Range's deleteContents() on the associated range, which is
the collapsed range returned by getSelection().getRangeAt(0) in the spec:
https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-selection-api-20160921/#widl-Selection-deleteFromDocument-void
And Range's deleteContents() immediately terminates in step 1 when start and end are identical:
https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/commit-snapshots/6b7621282c2e3b222ac585650e484abf4c0a416b/

Note that Range's DOM mutating methods are not available inside an user-agent shadow tree because
WebKit never returns a Range whose end boundary points are inside the tree to author scripts.
Editing commands (ones executable from document.execCommand) that mutate DOM like this check whether
the content is editable or not. Since VisibleSelection's validate() function makes sure the selection
is either entirely within or outside of an root editable element (editing host in the W3C spec lingo),
editing commands should never mutate a random node inside an user-agent shadow tree.

LayoutTests:

Based on a patch by Chris Dumez. Add a regression test and rebaseline a Blink test as WebKit's
new behavior matches that of Gecko instead of Blink.
