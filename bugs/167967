REGRESSION: LayoutTest http/tests/security/credentials-iframes.html is failing on ios-simulator
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167967

Reviewed by Brady Eidson.

Source/WebCore:

XHR credentials have a persistence of CredentialPersistenceNone because we keep
them in the WebCore::CredentialStorage.  We were storing them to CFNetwork's NSURLCredentialStorage
on iOS and then they were being given as the proposedCredential in
NetworkDataTaskCocoa::tryPasswordBasedAuthentication even though we set CredentialPersistenceNone.

This fixes http/tests/security/credentials-iframes.html
