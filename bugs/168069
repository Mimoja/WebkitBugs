An assertion failure inside removeChildren
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168069

Reviewed by Brent Fulgham.

Source/WebCore:

The bug was caused by notifyRemovePendingSheet executing scripts synchronously where it shouldn't.

Removed the call to notifyRemovePendingSheetIfNeeded in notifyChildNodeRemoved. Instead, invoke it
in its call sites when they're safe.

Test: http/tests/security/move-iframe-within-focus-handler-inside-removal.html

* dom/ContainerNode.cpp:
(WebCore::ContainerNode::takeAllChildrenFrom):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::notifyChildInserted):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::removeChild):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::replaceAllChildren):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::removeChildren):
* dom/ContainerNodeAlgorithms.cpp:
(WebCore::notifyChildNodeRemoved):

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/move-iframe-within-focus-handler-inside-removal-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/move-iframe-within-focus-handler-inside-removal.html: Added.
