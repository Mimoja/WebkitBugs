REGRESSION(r212218): Assertion failures in and after parserRemoveChild
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168458

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Source/WebCore:

The bug was caused by parserRemoveChild not preceeding to remove oldChild even when
oldChild had been inserted elsewhere during unload evnets of the disconnected frames.
Fixed the bug by checking this condition and exiting early.

Also fixed various callers of parserRemoveChild to not call parserAppendChild when
the removed node had already been inserted elsewhere by scripts.

Tests: fast/parser/adoption-agency-unload-iframe-3.html
       fast/parser/adoption-agency-unload-iframe-4.html
       fast/parser/xml-error-unload-iframe.html

* dom/ContainerNode.cpp:
(WebCore::ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild): Exit early when the node had been
inserted elsewhere while firing unload events. Also moved the call to
notifyRemovePendingSheetIfNeeded outside NoEventDispatchAssertion since it can
synchrnously fire a focus event.
(WebCore::ContainerNode::parserAppendChild): Moved adoptNode call to inside
NoEventDispatchAssertion since adoptNode call here should never mutate DOM.
* html/parser/HTMLConstructionSite.cpp:
(WebCore::executeReparentTask): Added an early exit when the node had already been
inserted elsewhere.
(WebCore::executeInsertAlreadyParsedChildTask): Ditto.
* xml/XMLErrors.cpp:
(WebCore::XMLErrors::insertErrorMessageBlock): Ditto.
* xml/parser/XMLDocumentParser.cpp:
(WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::end): Fixed a crash unveiled by one of the test cases.
Exit early when insertErrorMessageBlock detached the parser (by author scripts).
(WebCore::XMLDocumentParser::finish): Keep the parser alive until we exit.

LayoutTests:

Add tests to make sure parserAppendChild aren't called when a node removed by parserRemoveChild
had already been been inserted elsewhere by scripts.
