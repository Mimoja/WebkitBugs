Make RepaintRegionAccumulator hold a WeakPtr to its root RenderView
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=168480
<rdar://problem/30566976>

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

Source/WebCore:

Implements two mitigations to prevent the symptoms of the bug from occurring (see the bugzilla for more details).

Test: editing/execCommand/show-modal-dialog-during-execCommand.html

* editing/EditorCommand.cpp:
(WebCore::Editor::Command::execute):

Do not allow edit commands to execute if the frame's document before and after layout differ (that is, edit commands
triggered by a certain document should not run on a different document).

* rendering/RenderView.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderView::RenderView):
(WebCore::RenderView::RepaintRegionAccumulator::RepaintRegionAccumulator):

Turns RepaintRegionAccumulator's reference to its root RenderView into a WeakPtr to gracefully handle the case
where its RenderView is destroyed before RepaintRegionAccumulator's destructor gets a chance to flush the
RenderView's repaint regions.

* rendering/RenderView.h:

LayoutTests:

Introduces a new layout test. See WebCore ChangeLog for more details.

* TestExpectations:
* editing/execCommand/show-modal-dialog-during-execCommand-expected.txt: Added.
* editing/execCommand/show-modal-dialog-during-execCommand.html: Added.
* editing/execCommand/resources/self-closing-modal-dialog.html: Added.
* platform/mac-wk1/TestExpectations:
