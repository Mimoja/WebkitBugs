Check what LocalStorage data exists in deleteDatabasesModifiedSince() before attempting deletion.
It is possible that another process has caused information to be added to LocalStorage
after we created this LocalStorageDatabaseTracker instance, so we should update our
internal state by checking the contents of StorageTracker.db and the other local
storage files so we know what databases actually exist. By calling importOriginIdentifiers()
at the start of deleteDatabasesModifiedSince(), m_origins will now have the up-to-date
list of origins LocalStorage contains data for.
