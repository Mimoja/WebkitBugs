Source/WebCore:

Tests: DatabaseTrackerTest.DeleteDatabaseFileIfEmpty verifies that we actually delete an empty file.

Instead of checking that a database file's size is zero bytes, we should check if it contains
any tables. Once we open an empty database file and set its journal mode to WAL, it will have a
valid SQLite header and therefore will no longer be empty. We can know that the database was empty
if it does not contain any tables.

* Modules/webdatabase/DatabaseTracker.cpp:
(WebCore::DatabaseTracker::deleteDatabaseFileIfEmpty):
Use BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION in order to obtain the exclusive lock. If the database doesn't contain
any tables, it is empty and can be deleted.

Source/WebKit/mac:

Check if the folder for an origin's WebSQL databases is empty after trying to delete
all of its files. Currently we check if the deletedDatabaseFileCount matches the number
of files that were in the folder. However, when we delete the actual database file in
DatabaseTracker::deleteDatabaseFileIfEmpty(), the shm and wal files get deleted along with
the database file, but deletedDatabaseFileCount only gets incremented once.

* Storage/WebDatabaseManager.mm:
(+[WebDatabaseManager removeEmptyDatabaseFiles]):
Delete the folder if it is empty.

Tools:

Add a test for DatabaseTracker::deleteDatabaseFileIfEmpty that verifies
that if we pass in an empty file it actually gets deleted.

* TestWebKitAPI/TestWebKitAPI.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
Add TestWebKitAPI/Tests/WebCore/DatabaseTrackerTest.cpp.
* TestWebKitAPI/Tests/WebCore/DatabaseTrackerTest.cpp: Added.
