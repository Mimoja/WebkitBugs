Clean up touch event handler registration when moving nodes between documents
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=170384
rdar://problem/30816694

Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

Source/WebCore:

Make sure that Node::didMoveToNewDocument() does the correct unregistration on the
old document, and registration on the new document for nodes with touch event listeners,
and gesture event listeners. Touch "handler" nodes (those for overflow and sliders) are
already correctly moved via renderer-related teardown.

Add assertions that fire when removal was not complete.

Use references in more places.
