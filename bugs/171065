Do not measure large chunk of text repeatedly during mid-word breaking.

<rdar://problem/31630245>

Reviewed by Antti Koivisto.

This patch reduces redundant text measuring for mid-word breaking by
1. Adjusting the range for the binary search when the text fragment is longer than the available width
2. Preserving the width value for the left side of the split fragment (computed during the binary search) so
that when the fragment is being split we don't need to re-measure it
3. Checking if the right side fits the next line and only adjust the width (by re-measuring the text) for
kerning/ligature if it does (if it does not fit, we'll end up re-measuring some part of it
during the next split)

Performance test has already been added.
