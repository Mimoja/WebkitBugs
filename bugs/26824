        <rdar://problem/7018610> EventHandler can operate on a wrong frame if focus changes during
        keyboard event dispatch.

        EventHandler object is tied to a frame, so it's wrong for it to continue processing a keyboard
        event if focused frame changes between keydown and keypress.

        * manual-tests/focus-change-between-key-events.html: Added.

        * page/EventHandler.cpp: (WebCore::EventHandler::keyEvent): Bail out early if focused frame
        changes while dispatching keydown. Also made similar changes for Windows to maintain matching
        behavior, even though EventHandler was re-entered anyway due to WM_KEYDOWN and WM_CHAR being
        separate events.
