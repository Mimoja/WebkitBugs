        We need to be slightly more careful about how we pick up a script
        execution context.  In particular, we were getting the wrong document
        for frames that had been navigated somewhere else.

        In the long term, we should think about a better algorithm for
        computing the script context.

        Fixes LayoutTests/http/tests/xmlhttprequest/detaching-frame-2.html
