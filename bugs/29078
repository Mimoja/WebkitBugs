Reviewed by Darin Adler.

WebCore: 

Add a mechanism to blacklist certain codecs.  Initially, just blacklist UTF-7 as HTML5 encourages.

* platform/text/TextEncodingRegistry.cpp:
(WebCore::pruneBlacklistedCodecs):
(WebCore::buildBaseTextCodecMaps):
(WebCore::extendTextCodecMaps):

LayoutTests: 

Test the lack of UTF-7 support. Remove old UTF-7 tests.
