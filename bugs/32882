        Tests that we do not crash when auto-focus triggers a attach.

        Make auto-focus a post attach callback in
        HTMLFormControlElement::attach().
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32882

        Original patch by Darin Adler. This one uses a part of it.
        
        Test: fast/forms/input-element-attach-crash.html

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::recalcStyle): Make sure that m_inStyleRecalc is
        already false by the time post-attach callbacks are done so that
        layout triggered inside those callbacks can work properly.
        * html/HTMLFormControlElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::shouldAutofocus): Helper function that expresses
        the rule for which form control elements should auto-focus.
        (WebCore::focusPostAttach): Called post-attach to focus an
        element if we discover it should be focused during attach.
        (WebCore::HTMLFormControlElement::attach): Refactored code for
        which elements need auto-focus into a separate function. Instead
        of focusing right away, use the focusPostAttach function to focus
        after attach is done. Also added calls to suspendPostAttachCallbacks
        and resumePostAttachCallbacks so post-attach callbacks happen late
        enough. Before, they could run inside the base attach function.
        * html/HTMLInputElement.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputElement::attach): Added calls to
        suspendPostAttachCallbacks and resumePostAttachCallbacks so
        post-attach callbacks happen late enough
