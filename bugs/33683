        Stylesheet href property shows redirected URL unlike other browsers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33683

        Test whether the href property of style sheets contains the original or
        final URL of the redirect chain that lead to the style sheet.

        I couldn't figure out how to test the XSLStyleSheet parts of this
        change.  There didn't seem to be DOM bindings for the href property
        here.  If I missed it, please let me know.
