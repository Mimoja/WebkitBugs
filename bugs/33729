rdar://problem/7545114

Reviewed by Oliver Hunt and Alexey Proskuryakov.

WebCore: 

Test: fast/forms/ValidityState-removed-control.html

* html/HTMLFormControlElement.h: Use OwnPtr instead of
RefPtr to point to the ValidityState object.

* html/ValidityState.cpp: Use a constant instead of a
macro for the email validation regular expression.
(WebCore::ValidityState::validationMessage): Use
m_control instead of control function; we don't need
a function for this. Also marked const.
(WebCore::ValidityState::typeMismatch): Ditto.
Fixed some minor style problems.
(WebCore::ValidityState::rangeUnderflow): Ditto.
(WebCore::ValidityState::rangeOverflow): Ditto.
(WebCore::ValidityState::stepMismatch): Ditto.
(WebCore::ValidityState::valid): Ditto.
(WebCore::ValidityState::isValidEmailAddress):
Changed local variable names for clarity. Got rid of
an unneeded global variable.

* html/ValidityState.h: Removed RefCounted as a base
class, deriving from Noncopyable instead. Changed
creation to use PassOwnPtr instead of PassRefPtr.
Eliminated unneeded control function. Added ref and
deref functions that forward the reference counting
to the control. Moved constructor here and made it
inline.

LayoutTests: 

* fast/forms/ValidityState-removed-control-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/forms/ValidityState-removed-control.html: Added.
