WebCore: Fix hard-to-see crash due to incorrect libxml API usage.

Patch by Chris Evans <cevans@chromium.org> on 2010-03-23
Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Test: fast/text/bad-encoding.html

* dom/XMLTokenizerLibxml2.cpp:
(WebCore::XMLTokenizer::doEnd): Avoid operations on a closed context.

LayoutTests: Add test for crash due to calling into libxml in invalid state. Note
that it is unlikely that this will actually crash for you in the test
environment because it is highly intermittent. However, adding test in
order to exercise the code path and prevent related regression.
