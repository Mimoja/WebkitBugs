Manipulating document fragment members while adding it to tree may result in loss of tree integrity.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36031

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

WebCore:

Changes the logic of appending/inserting document fragment to first stashing all of its children
to a vector, then processing the vector. This avoids ghastliness that would be caused by mutation
events mucking with the document fragment while it's being appended/inserted.

Test: fast/dom/Node/fragment-mutation.html

* dom/ContainerNode.cpp:
(WebCore::targetNodes): Added method to populate a vector of nodes (targets) to be used in
    inserting/appending operation.
(WebCore::ContainerNode::insertBefore): Changed to use vector-based iteration.
(WebCore::ContainerNode::appendChild): Ditto.
* dom/Node.cpp:
(WebCore::Node::checkReplaceChild): Cleaned up comments.
(WebCore::Node::checkAddChild): Ditto.

LayoutTests:

These tests study various side-effects of DOM mutation events fired during appending/inserting
document fragments.

* fast/dom/Node/fragment-mutation-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/dom/Node/fragment-mutation.html: Added.
