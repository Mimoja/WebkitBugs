        sandbox iframes have access to top.history methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38152

        To enforce the sandbox restrictions on History, we need to pass the
        ScriptExecutionContext to WebCore.  This patch leaves the original
        History methods in place because they are used directly by folks who
        don't care about security checks.

        Test: fast/frames/sandboxed-iframe-history-denied.html

        * page/History.cpp:
        (WebCore::History::back):
        (WebCore::History::forward):

        sandbox iframes have access to top.history methods
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38152

        Test that sandboxed iframes cannot use history to navigate the top
        frame.  This test is less than ideal, as described in the test itself.
        If I was really on top of things, I'd add a test for successful use of
        the history API when allow-top-navigation is set, but that test would
        be complicated and I'm lazy (enough to copy directly from abarth).
