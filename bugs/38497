        <rdar://problem/7759438> Make sure that http URLs always have a host in SecurityOrigin

        This is a hardening fix, and behavior really depends on what an underlying networking layer
        does. So, no test.

        * page/SecurityOrigin.cpp:
        (WebCore::schemeRequiresAuthority): List schemes that need an authority for successful loading.
        (WebCore::SecurityOrigin::SecurityOrigin): Never let e.g. http origins with empty authorities
        have the same security origin.
