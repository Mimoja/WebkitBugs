Filter files from dataTransfer.getData on Mac

Reviewed by Enrica Casucci.

Source/WebCore:

The ClipboardMac class now keeps track of whether it was created for copy and paste, dragging and dropping
files or dragging and dropping generic data. This enables the class to block calls to set-/getData when the
clipboard is not operating on generic data, and vice-versa.

Test: fast/events/drop-with-file-paths.html
