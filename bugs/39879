        Geolocation activity started after frame has been disconnected can cause crash
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39879

        New requests started after the Frame has been disconnected are ignored. We do
        not invoke the error callback as this would allow buggy or malicious pages to
        hose the CPU. Such a page could hold a reference to a Geolocation object from
        a since closed Page and register new requests from the error callback to
        create an infinite loop.
