        <rdar://problem/8324423> CSSOM should match DOM in discarding wrapper-less parents.

        We have existing behaviors where parent objects in detached subtrees are not preserved:
        - if a root of a node tree doesn't have a wrapper, it's immediately destroyed, making
        its children parentNode attribute null;
        - relationship between a <style> or <link> node and its stylesheet is immediately broken
        when the node is removed from document (in this case, regardless of wrapper existence).

        Both match Firefox. For consistency, CSSOM should do the same. In fact, it already partially
        does - CSSRule.parentRule gets zeroed out when the parent rule is destroyed.

        Tests: fast/dom/StyleSheet/detached-parent-rule-without-wrapper.html

        * css/StyleSheet.cpp: (WebCore::StyleSheet::~StyleSheet): Clear out child rule parent.

        * svg/SVGFontFaceElement.cpp: (WebCore::SVGFontFaceElement::insertedIntoDocument): Keep
        the new assertion from firing. This function was adding a rule to style sheet, without
        telling the rule about it.
