        We're not supposed to load resources in detached documents.  According
        to several locations I examined, it's the job of the caller of
        DocLoader to check this invariant.  Like most code dealing with
        detached documents, this check isn't overly consistent.  At some point,
        we'll need to rationalize all the different patterns here.  However, at
        this point, this patch appears correct because it matches what we do
        for <link rel="stylesheet">.

        Test what happens when you insert a link prefetch element into a
        detached document.
