        [chromium] fix memory corruption in Khmer rendering.

        Test: fast/text/khmer-crash.html

        * platform/graphics/chromium/FontLinux.cpp:
        (WebCore::TextRunWalker::shapeGlyphs):
          The Khmer shaper has a bug where it would request larger output
          buffers, but request a zero increase in size. Because of this we add
          one to the requested size.
        (WebCore::TextRunWalker::setGlyphXPositions):
          The Khmer shaper is outputing cluster logs which suggest that some
          output glyphs appear from nowhere (i.e. have no input codepoints). I
          don't know Khmer, so maybe that's correct, but it broke the
          assumptions of this code, causing a read out-of-bounds.
        * platform/graphics/chromium/HarfbuzzSkia.cpp:
        (WebCore::stringToGlyphs):
          The Harfbuzz interfaces aren't documented, but it appears that the
          output array to stringToGlyphs isn't sized and that Harfbuzz expects
          us to detect when the input is too long.
