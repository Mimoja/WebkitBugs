        move-during-parse-parent.html crashes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45210

        When inserting elements into the tree, they need to be associated with
        their parent's document, not the document for which the parser is
        running.  These two are different when the parent has been moved to a
        different document during parsing.
