        V8 security checks don't account for shadowing named frames
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45700

        Test: http/tests/security/xss-DENIED-frame-name.html

        * bindings/v8/custom/V8DOMWindowCustom.cpp:
        (WebCore::V8DOMWindow::namedSecurityCheck):
            - If the property name exists on the object, it will shadow the
              named property lookup on the window object.  That means we need
              to block access if there's shadowing going on.
        (WebCore::V8DOMWindow::indexedSecurityCheck):
            - I made the corresponding change to this function too, but I don't
              think this one can actually be triggered because JavaScript
              variable names need to start with a non-digit.
