        <rdar://problem/8461701> Document.getElementById() malfunctions if ID was changed via Attr node modification.

        Test: fast/dom/Attr/change-id-via-attr-node-value.html

        * dom/Attr.h:
        * dom/Attr.cpp:
        (WebCore::Attr::setValue): Separated a version callable from WebCore from one avaiable to JS.
        Attr::setValue() can be called from Element::setAttribute(), and we don't want to update
        m_elementsById (or to call attributeChanged()) twice in that case.
        (WebCore::Attr::childrenChanged): If Attr's node children change, id changes.

        * dom/Document.cpp: (WebCore::Document::removeElementById): Added an assertion that we are
        not trying to remove something that isn't there. If we are, we probably failed to update
        m_elementsById earlier.

        * dom/Element.cpp: (WebCore::Element::setAttribute): If the attribute has an Attr node, its
        children should be updated to match attribute value.
