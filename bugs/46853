        Add code in getMatchedCSSRules to block cross origin access to stylesheet data. Prevent access
        in Javascript to non author stylesheets.

        Tests that cross origin bypass does not work with getMatchedCSSRules. Rebaseline existing tests
        that try to access non-author stylesheets. This functionality is no longer supported. So, css rules
        should return null for those cases.
