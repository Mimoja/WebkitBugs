        Crash when moving caret around a word with a first-letter rule and whitespace is not collapsible.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49652

        Fixed the crash by giving the correct end offset to emitText in handleTextNode.

        This patch does not fix a bug in TextIterator that incorrectly calculates
        the end offset of a word with a first-letter rule as demonstrated in the layout test
        because fixing the bug requires an overhaul of TextIterator and new behavior is consistent
        with the case when whitespace is collapsible.

        Added a test to ensure WebKit does not crash when moving carets around a word
        with a first-letter rule.  While WebKit no longer crashes, the test demonstrates a bug
        that the position offset at the end of word is incorrect.
