        document.close shouldn't affect non-script-created parsers
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53689

        Tests for various cases involving document.open/write/close.  Not all
        of them are related to this patch, but they were helpful to me in
        working through this patch, so I've added them in case they're useful
        in the future.

        Move our implementation of document.close closer to the spec by
        introducing the notion of a script-created parser.  This area of our
        code is somewhat hairy.  It might take a few more iterations before we
        fully come up to spec.

        * dom/Document.cpp:
        (WebCore::Document::setContent):
        (WebCore::Document::open):
        (WebCore::Document::cancelParsing):
        (WebCore::Document::close):
            - Over time, this method should converge to the spec.
        (WebCore::Document::explicitClose):
            - I'm not in love with this name.  Somehow we want to differentiate
              between Document closing itself and the document.close DOM
              method.
        (WebCore::Document::removePendingSheet):
        * dom/Document.h:
        * dom/ScriptableDocumentParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::ScriptableDocumentParser::ScriptableDocumentParser):
        * dom/ScriptableDocumentParser.h:
        (WebCore::ScriptableDocumentParser::setWasCreatedByScript):
        (WebCore::ScriptableDocumentParser::wasCreatedByScript):
            - General nonsense to keep track of whether the parser was created
              by script.
        * html/parser/HTMLDocumentParser.cpp:
        (WebCore::HTMLDocumentParser::hasInsertionPoint):
            - I'm not sure whether this part of the change is 100% correct.  I
              think our notion of the EOF character might be subtly different
              from the notion in the spec.
        * html/parser/HTMLInputStream.h:
        (WebCore::HTMLInputStream::hasInsertionPoint):
            - Remove FIXME because we're fixing that!
