        Remove the early bail added in r75823 since we can run into anonymous
        blocks when traversing the parents chain for clearing floats.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54601

        removeFloatingOrPositionedChildFromBlockLists tries to find the topmost
        parent containing "this" block and then tries to remove it from its floats
        list and mark all descendants blocks for layout. I added a bailout condition
        in r75823 because we thought that if one of the parent render block does not 
        contain "this" float, then it is safe to assume that none of the grand parents
        will have it. This is a wrong assumption since anonymous blocks do not have
        float objects and we need to go higher in the chain to find the top most parent
        containing this float. Instead of breaking out of the loop, it is ok to keep
        traversing the chain till we find that parent. Otherwise, we will leave deleted
        floats in the grand parents floats list.

        Tests that we do not crash when floats are not cleared in cases where parents
        chain has anonymous blocks.
