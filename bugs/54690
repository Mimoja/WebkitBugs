        Don't add inline continuation outline to the containing block's
        continuationOutlineTable list if it is not enclosed by an anonymous block.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54690

        We currently don't reconnect inline continuations after a child removal.
        As a result, those merged inlines do not get seperated and hence not get enclosed
        by anonymous blocks. In this case, it is better to bail out and paint it ourself.

        Test: fast/table/table-continuation-outline-paint-crash.html

        * rendering/InlineFlowBox.cpp:
        (WebCore::InlineFlowBox::paint): 
        * rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderBlock::paintsContinuationOutline): helper function to tell
        if this containing block has the continuation flow in its continuations list.
        * rendering/RenderBlock.h: helper function definition.
        * rendering/RenderInline.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderInline::destroy): debug only code that asserts if we leave
        behind a continuation in the containing block's continuation list when it is
        getting destroyed.

        Ensure that we do not add the inline continuation flow to the table's continuation
        table map for painting. The layout test should not crash on assert and should show
        a solid outline around the inline child.
