        Crash when deleting inside a blockquote with a large offset
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55098

        The bug was caused by inconsistency in lineBreakExistsAtPosition and breakOutOfEmptyMailBlockquotedParagraph.
        While lineBreakExistsAtPosition was checking that a line break exists at the downstream of the given position,
        breakOutOfEmptyMailBlockquotedParagraph wasn't using the downstream for caretPos. Fixed the bug by using
        the downstream position to instantiate caretPos.

        Crash when deleting inside a blockquote with a large offset
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55098

        Added a test to ensure WebKit doesn't crash when deleting line inside a blockquote
        and the caret is programmatically set to have a large offset.
