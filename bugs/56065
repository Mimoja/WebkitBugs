        No new tests. This bug could only be reproduced manually by
        refreshing the page during load at a critical point.
        See bug attachment for testing.

        * rendering/CounterNode.cpp:
        Introduced new member "m_owner" to store the renderer that has the
        style directives that produce the CounterNode.
        Repurposed m_renderer to reffer to the RenderCounter that shows the
        CounterNode.
        (WebCore::CounterNode::CounterNode):
        Updated member initialization.
        (WebCore::CounterNode::create):
        (WebCore::CounterNode::addRenderer):
        (WebCore::CounterNode::removeRenderer):
        Introduced to manage the renderer list associated wit this CounterNode.
        (WebCore::CounterNode::resetRenderers):
        This is the old resetRenderer. Renamed to take into account that there may be
        more than one renderer to a CounterNode.
        (WebCore::CounterNode::resetThisAndDescendantsRenderers):
        This is the old resetRenderers renamed for clarity.
        (WebCore::CounterNode::recount):
        (WebCore::CounterNode::insertAfter):
        (WebCore::CounterNode::removeChild):
        No functional changes.
        (WebCore::showTreeAndMark):
        Added flushing to ensure that the output is complete.
        * rendering/CounterNode.h:
        (WebCore::CounterNode::owner):
        Renamed from renderer()
        * rendering/RenderCounter.cpp:
        (WebCore::findPlaceForCounter):
        Fixed comments. No functional changes.
        (WebCore::RenderCounter::~RenderCounter):
        Made sure that the CounterNode that this renderers displays is
        detached from this.
        (WebCore::RenderCounter::originalText):
        (WebCore::RenderCounter::invalidate):
        Changed to maintain the bidirectional relationship with the displayed CounterNode.
        Also made "invalidate" private as it should be used only by CounterNode.
        (WebCore::destroyCounterNodeWithoutMapRemoval):
        (WebCore::RenderCounter::destroyCounterNodes):
        (WebCore::RenderCounter::destroyCounterNode):
        (WebCore::updateCounters):
        No change, just kept code in line with the changes above.
        (showCounterRendererTree):
        Added fflush to ensure complete display.
        * rendering/RenderCounter.h:
        * rendering/RenderObjectChildList.cpp:
        * rendering/RenderObjectChildList.h:
        Removed unneeded invalidateCounters related functions.
