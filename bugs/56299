        When style changes for a RenderBlock and we lose our ability to intrude into
        floats in the next siblings block (e.g a position change), make sure to mark
        our childs with floats for layout and iterate through our next sibling block
        chain to see which ones contain the float that also exists in our floating
        objects list and clear those using markAllDescendantsWithFloatsForLayout.

        Tests that we do not crash when trying to add overflow from a float not in the
        descendant list and whose renderer is already removed.
