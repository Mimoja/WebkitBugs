        Don't call WebSocket::didClose() more than once.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57081

        If WebSocket close() is called, and connection is established, then
        it will call didClose() that resets m_channel to 0.
        After that, when connection is closed, WebSocketChannel will call
        didClose for the WebSocket instance.

        Call WebSocketChannel::disconnect() before m_channel = 0 to make sure
        WebSocketChannel suppress the second didClose().
