Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Rework visited/unvisited links for before/after content. Propagate the bits earlier so that we don't lose
them when we throw away the visited style. Don't throw away the visited link style for pseudo elements
either, so that the styles are consistent.

Source/WebCore: 

Added fast/history/visited-generated-content-test.html

* css/CSSStyleSelector.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::styleForElement):
(WebCore::CSSStyleSelector::pseudoStyleForElement):

LayoutTests: 

* fast/history/visited-generated-content-test-expected.txt: Added.
