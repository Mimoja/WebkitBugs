        Possible crash when removing elements with reflections
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60009

        RenderLayer's destructor deleted its z-order list Vector pointers
        before removing the reflection layer. However, the reflection cleanup
        code could call back into the RenderLayer to dirty z-order lists,
        so move reflection cleanup to before z-order vector deletion.

        The test crashes when run manually a few times with MallocScribble enabled,
        but I was not able to create a test that crashed reliably.

        Test: fast/reflections/remove-reflection-crash.html

        * rendering/RenderLayer.cpp:
        (WebCore::RenderLayer::~RenderLayer):
