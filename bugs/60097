fast/dom/HTMLLinkElement/link-and-subresource-test.html is flaky on chromium debug bots
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60097

The culprit was that CachedResource:stopLoading() was using *this
after a call to checkNotify(), which isn't kosher.  This patch
uses a CachedResourceHandle to keep the CachedResource alive.

Source/WebCore:

The test is a very close copy of the eponymous
link-and-subresource-test.html, only substituting invalid
resources for the valid ones in that test.  The reproduction is
timing related, and happens much more consistantly with an invalid
resource for whatever reason.
