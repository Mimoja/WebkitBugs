Use after free because of line box culling optimization regression.

In the case of a child with no line box being removed (typically
a <br> in quirks mode), if there is no previous sibling with a line
box, then we have a potential problem with the culling optimization.

The culled inline may still have other leaf line box children, but
they may follow the removed <br>. In this case we can't rely on
them, since we need a line box that comes before the <br>.

The fix is to simply recur up to the parent if we are a culled inline
and could not find a previous line box.
