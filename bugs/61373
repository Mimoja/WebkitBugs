Source/WebCore: Harden arithmetic in ImageBufferDataCG
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61373

Reviewed by Gavin Barraclough.

We have a checked type that allows us to automate many of the
bounds checks we want here, so let's replace the floating point
math, and just use Checked<> throughout.  We use a non-recording
Checked<> as no overflows should reach this point, so we'll take
a hard early failure, over the cost of many branches when
accessing the raw values in loops.

Source/WTF: Investigate overflows in Canvas putImageData routine

Allow floating point multiplies of checked types (complete with
bounds checks).
