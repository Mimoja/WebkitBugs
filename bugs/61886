Safari always crashes on http://bbc.co.uk when VoiceOver enabled

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

This crash can happen on webpages that remove an element from the DOM when the element receives focus.
When AppKit goes to post a notification to inform VoiceOver the focus has changed, it asks for the AXFocusedUIElement.
However by posting that notification, a render tree update is performed. This causes the element to disappear, but
AppKit still has a handle to it and continues to try to reference it. When the autorelease pool pops, the reference goes bad.

To fix, the root element, the AccessibilityScrollView, needs to implement updateBackingStore(), otherwise this method 
will not be called in time.

No test could be created because to cause it depends on an internal AppKit mechanism
that is only triggered remotely through the accessibility runtime.
