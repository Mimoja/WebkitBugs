        window.location should use the holder's prototype chain
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63411

        This patch corrects the prototype chain for Location, but we really
        should do a complete cleanup of the prototype chain generation, like we
        did for JavaScriptCore.

        Test: http/tests/security/location-prototype.html
