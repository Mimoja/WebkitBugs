Partial layout when a flex-box has visibility: collapse
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63776

Source/WebCore:

Tests: fast/flexbox/crash-button-input-autofocus.html
       fast/flexbox/crash-button-keygen.html
       fast/flexbox/crash-button-relayout.html

The issue is that FlexBoxIterator would skip any child if it has visibility: collapsed.
However if one of the child is anonymous, it may wrap some other child that would be skipped.
Now FlexBoxIterator is called during the layout phase and thus some nodes would not relayouted
as expected.

* rendering/RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox.cpp:
(WebCore::FlexBoxIterator::next): When iterating, don't skip anonymous content as there may
be real content hiding below.

LayoutTests:

Those tests checks some variation of the same underlying issue.
