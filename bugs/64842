RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox does not call its children's layout method
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64842

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

Tests: fast/flexbox/021-vertical.html
       fast/flexbox/crash-flexbox-no-layout-child.html

The FlexBoxIterator would skip any child with visibility: collapsed. However those child
would need layout but their layout() function would never be called.

This change refactors the way flexible box handles visibility: collapsed child and mark sure
their layout() function is called but makes sure that they don't participate in the flex box
dimensions.

* rendering/RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox.cpp:
(WebCore::FlexBoxIterator::next): Do not skip visibility: collapsed child.
(WebCore::childDoesNotAffectWidthOrFlexing): Helper function.

(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::calcHorizontalPrefWidths):
(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::calcVerticalPrefWidths):
(WebCore::gatherFlexChildrenInfo):
(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::layoutHorizontalBox):
(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::layoutVerticalBox):
(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::applyLineClamp):
(WebCore::RenderDeprecatedFlexibleBox::allowedChildFlex):
Updated to skip the now seen visibility: collapsed child during the
iteration.

LayoutTests:

Added a test covering the vertical change as the horizontal one is covered
by 021.html. The test is failing currently as we don't properly support this
case.

Updated as we now layout out this flex-box. The image result should not
change as it doesn't contribute to the visible flexbox layout.
