ASSERT failure due to combine-text with preceding spaces
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65147

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-01-06
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

A couple of ASSERTs were failing due to a parsing problem when
advancing an inline iterator to the next linebreak in a
RenderCombineText. skipLeadingWhitespace advances the iterator
over leading whitespace but when searching for the line break
nextLineBreak would call RenderCombineText::combineText(),
collapsing the text so that the iterator is pointing past the
end of it.

This patch causes combineText() to be called during
skipLeadingWhiteSpace before iteration over the RenderCombineText
begins.

* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::LineBreaker::nextLineBreak):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::LineBreaker::skipLeadingWhitespace):

LayoutTests:

New test with combine-text that begins with mutiple spaces,
showing ASSERT failures in bug 65147.
