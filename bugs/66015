Crash due to mixed direction text runs
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66015

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2011-11-07
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

Test for bug fix.

* fast/text/international/bidi-neutral-in-mixed-direction-run-crash.html: Added
* fast/text/international/bidi-neutral-in-mixed-direction-run-cras-expected.txt: Added

LayoutTests:

In some cases extra bidi runs were being added because appendRun() was being called
after the last run of the line was already appended.

This converts a previous fix for this bug to an ASSERT, because the check is
unnecessary, though it is a symptom that text runs have somehow gotten messed up.

* rendering/InlineIterator.h:
(WebCore::InlineBidiResolver::appendRun): Abort append if we've already appended the last
run of the line
* rendering/RenderBox.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBox::positionLineBox): Revert the previous patch, change to an assert
