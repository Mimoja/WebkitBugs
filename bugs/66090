Regression(91788): Bad cast in WebCore::blockWithNextLineBox
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66090

Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

Source/WebCore:

This is more like (but not exactly) a revert of r91788.
It does not search for previous or next root inline box in different
render object, which completely eliminates the cause of this issue.
And it removes createPositionAvoidingIgnoredNode(), changed its caller
to use createLegacyEditingPosition(). createPositionAvoidingIgnoredNode
is not correct when node is a replaced element whose caretMaxOffset
could be greater than 1.
