Source/WebCore: Issues with merging block children of a ruby
base with another ruby base having inline children. 
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66124

* rendering/RenderRubyBase.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderRubyBase::moveInlineChildren): add a firstChild()
check to prevent empty anonymous block addition, just like
moveBlockChildren method.
* rendering/RenderRubyBase.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderRubyBase::moveBlockChildren): This was incorrectly
doing optimizations to see if current ruby base has only inline
children before beforeChild and then trying to take out them from 
their parent anonymous blocks. The problem is those inlines could
be split and have continuations because of encountering a block
inside inline flow. In those cases, we cannot take the inline out.
So, we should just make children non-inline in the destination
block and transfer the children as it-is.
* rendering/RenderRubyBase.h: remove unncessary functions.
