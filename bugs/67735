:before content rendering issues with list markers and run-ins.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67735

Source/WebCore: 

1) Remove the isAnonymous checks for run-in detection since the
run-in can belong to a node.
2) When the parent has block children, then the list marker will
be enclosed in an anonymous block. In that case, for going to the
next list marker, we need to traverse one level up. We don't need
this check when searching for generated run-in (loop 2), since we
know parent will have inline children, so the list marker wont be
enclosed in an anonymous block.
