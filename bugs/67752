Yarr assert with regexp where alternative in *-quantified group matches empty
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67752        

Reviewed by Gavin Barraclough.

Source/JavaScriptCore: 

Added backtracking for the prior alternative if it matched
but didn't consume any input characters.

* yarr/YarrJIT.cpp:
(YarrOp): New jump.
(JSC::Yarr::YarrGenerator::generate): Emit conditional jump
when an alternative matches and no input was consumed.  Moved the
zero length match check for a set of alternatives to the alternative
code from the parentheses cases to the alternative end cases.
Converted the existing zero length checks in the parentheses cases
to runtime assertion checks.
(JSC::Yarr::YarrGenerator::backtrack): Link new jump to backtrack
to prior term.

LayoutTests: 

Added new tests for alternatives that match without consuming 
any input characters.

* fast/js/regexp-zero-length-alternatives-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/js/regexp-zero-length-alternatives.html: Added.
* fast/js/script-tests/regexp-zero-length-alternatives.js: Added.
