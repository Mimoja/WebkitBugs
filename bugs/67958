Fix out-of-bounds access in Gradient::sortStopsIfNecessary
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67958

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

Reported by Valgrind in http://crbug.com/77049.

The errant code was added as an optimization in r67804.
This patch reverts that one, as all parties agree that the optimization
doesn't seem worthwhile, and there clearly aren't any tests covering
the special case.

No new tests, as existing tests should cover the remaining call to
|std::stable_sort|.
