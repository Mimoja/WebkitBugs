Fix a use-after-free: clear the fullscreen change event target queue at
detach time, rather than at destruction time. If this isn't done, it's
possible for the event target queue to be the only thing that
references the document. Then when the document is popped off the queue
and dereferenced in Document::fullScreenChangeDelayTimerFired, the
document is destroyed and the subsequent access to
m_fullScreenChangeEventTargetQueue.isEmpty() accesses free'd memory.
