        Web Inspector: InspectorInstrumentation::frameDestroyed is called after m_page has been reset.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67997

        We should not instrument frameDestroyed event from within Frame's destructor
        since frame's m_page pointer is likely to be 0 by that time and appropriate
        instrumenting agent won't be found. As a result, stale frame with its id
        end up in the inspector.

        This change wipes out frame binding from the inspector upon detach rather
        than destroy.
