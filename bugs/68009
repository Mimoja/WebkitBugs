Crash in RenderScrollbarPart::imageChanged.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68009

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore: 

When a custom scrollbar is removed from its FrameView, its destruction
can be delayed because of RefPtr maintained in EventHandler class
(m_lastScrollbarUnderMouse). Upon removal, we delete all the scrollbar
parts so that they don't link back to scrollbar. However, because of the
delay, we can have a call to updateScrollbarPart which recreates it.
When scrollbar is getting destroyed, we just check to see if there are
remaining scrollbar parts and if yes, we destroy them.
