Named property confusion with __proto__
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68221

Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Source/WebCore: 

The __proto__ property is super magical because it's not a real named
property and it has higher precedence than even interceptors.  This
confuses this check, which is meant to detech which names will get
handled by our interceptor.

Test: http/tests/security/window-named-proto.html
