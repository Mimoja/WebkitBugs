Style changes on forwarded shadow children should trigger shadow renderer reconstruction.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68228

Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

Currently style changes on forwarded shadow child triggers
Node::reattach() only for the forwarded node. But it should
invalidate whole renderers on the shadow tree because
ShadowContentElement expects its inclusions to be attached and to
create renderers in the inclusion order. But single node
reattach() violates the expectation and possibly creates
inconsistent render tree.

This change makes NodeRenderingContext to go
AttachContentForwarded, where the ShadowContentElement::attach()
happens, only during ShadowRoot::attach(), not for style-change
triggered Node::attach() on the forwarded nodes.

Note that the altering phase AttachContentLight doesn't create
renderers for the forwarded nodes. Instead of that, it possibly
triggers shadow subtree reconstruction on
NodeRenderingContext::hostChildrenChanged().

No new tests. This is a defensive change. There is no visible
difference at this time.
