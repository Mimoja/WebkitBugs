had associated anonymous blocks.

Move all children back to the parent, not just the firstChild.

LayoutTests:

When exiting fullscreen, if the child of the RenderFullScreen is a
block and the parent has inline flow elements, the parent's children
should be made non-inline before adding the fullscreened element back
to the parent.
