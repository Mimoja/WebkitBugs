Test: http/tests/security/xss-DENIED-getSelection-from-inactive-domwindow.html

* page/DOMWindow.cpp:
(WebCore::DOMWindow::~DOMWindow):
    - Add ASSERTs to show that we're not recreating these objects.
    - Add a call to clear() as defense in depth in case we have any of
      these objects hanging around.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::clear):
    - Clear out a couple of objects that weren't getting cleared.
      These are actually not likely to cause problems, but clearing
      them out is the safe thing to do.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::isActive):
    - Add a concept of whether the DOMWindow is "active" in its frame.
      We had this concept in a couple places already, but centralizing
      it into a helper function make it easier to use and talk about.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::orientation):
    - Whitespace nit.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::screen):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::history):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::crypto):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::locationbar):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::menubar):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::personalbar):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::scrollbars):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::statusbar):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::toolbar):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::console):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::applicationCache):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::navigator):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::performance):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::location):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::sessionStorage):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::localStorage):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitNotifications):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitIndexedDB):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::getSelection):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::styleMedia):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitURL):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitStorageInfo):
    - Avoid creating these objects when we're not active.  That can
      only lead to sadness.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitRequestFileSystem):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitResolveLocalFileSystemURL):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::openDatabase):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::postMessage):
    - While not techincally creating subobjects, these functions also
      seem unwise when the DOMWindow is inactive.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::find):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::length):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::getMatchedCSSRules):
    - These functions operate on the active Document.  When we're not
      active, that's not us!
(WebCore::DOMWindow::document):
    - Update to use the new concept of being active rather than having
      this function roll its own implementation.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::webkitConvertPointFromPageToNode):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::scrollBy):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::scrollTo):
    - These functions also look unwise to run when inactive because
      they're reading information from the active document.
    - I added a RefPtr for node because the call to
      updateLayoutIgnorePendingStylesheets() seems likely to be able to
      run script somehow.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::addEventListener):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::removeEventListener):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::dispatchLoadEvent):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::dispatchEvent):
    - I don't think these functions worked when inactive anyway, but
      explicitly blocking them seems wise.
(WebCore::DOMWindow::setLocation):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::isInsecureScriptAccess):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::open):
(WebCore::DOMWindow::showModalDialog):
    - These already have checks for being active, but it can't hurt to
      be explicit at the top of the function.
