Crash due to nested first-letter selectors
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70457

Source/WebCore:

Now only the lowest-level first-letter pseudostyle will be applied to
a given piece of text. Previously the last renderer to have layout
done would have its pseudostyle applied, no matter where it was in the
tree.

* renderer/RenderBlock.cpp:
