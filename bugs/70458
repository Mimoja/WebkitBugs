Crash when splitting inline flows with generated floats
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70458

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2011-10-28
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

When lineBoxes on a RenderBlock are being deleted, we now check the floating object list to
ensure references to them are being cleared.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::deleteLineBoxTree): Remove references to lineBox when deleting them

LayoutTests:

Added test for crash condition when splitting inline flows on an object with generated floats.

* fast/css-generated-content/inline-splitting-with-after-float-crash.html: Added
* fast/css-generated-content/inline-splitting-with-after-float-crash-expected.txt: Added
