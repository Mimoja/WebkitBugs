Race condition in SocketStreamHandleCFNet when PAC script is used
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70894

Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

Pass callback functions that call ref() or deref() as retain/release member
of CFStreamClientContext.

No new tests, as it is not possible to write a test with PAC script enabled.

* platform/network/cf/SocketStreamHandle.h:
* platform/network/cf/SocketStreamHandleCFNet.cpp:
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::scheduleStreams):
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::retainSocketStreamHandle):
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::releaseSocketStreamHandle):
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::pacExecutionCallbackMainThread):
This callback may be called after platformClose() is already called. We should
not create new streams in this case.
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::executePACFileURL):
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::readStreamCallback):
This manual ref/deref can be safely removed as m_readStream holds the reference.
(WebCore::SocketStreamHandle::writeStreamCallback):
Ditto.
