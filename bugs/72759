Crash from first letter text fragments having flows split
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72759

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2011-11-30
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

When an inline flow is split that contains a first letter block
and its remaining text, it can prevent the remaining text fragment
from getting updated if the first letter block is replaced. This
patch enables the text fragment to be found and updated properly.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::updateFirstLetterBlock):

LayoutTests:

New test for fix to crash on bug 72759.
