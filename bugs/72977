Crash from line break iterators in counter content
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72977

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-02-14
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

Calculating the width of counter text can sometimes cause the
underlying text buffer to change. This patch causes the iterator
to reset appropriately when this happens.

* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::LineBreaker::nextLineBreak):

LayoutTests:

Test that causes asterisk counters to change during layout
and potentially confuse iterators.
