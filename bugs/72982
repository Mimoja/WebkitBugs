Crash when accessing removed parent in InlineTextBox.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=72982

Reviewed by James Robinson.

Source/WebCore: 

The crash happens because:
1. We add heading element(h1) before the span element(span1),
   causing splitflow on the anonymous block containing BeforeText,
   span1(and SpanText) and AfterText.
2. span1 moves to the cloneBlock (continuation).
3. Our anonymous block and cloneBlock are both marked for layout,
   however we still have a copy of our lineboxes with its childs
   as the textboxes belonging to SpanText.
4. Our anonymous block only child BeforeText is getting removed,
   so we dont have any children anymore and we delete our lineboxes,
   leaving behind the children textboxes belonging to SpanText.
5. SpanText is getting destroyed, so it tries to inform removed
   parent lineboxes causing the crash.
