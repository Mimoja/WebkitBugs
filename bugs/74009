Crash due to first-letter block processing
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74009

Source/WebCore:

Fixing the way updateFirstLetter() finds the remaining text fragment
for a given first-letter. Previously this was unreliable in some
circumstances.

This patch provides a reliable mechanism to identify the remaining
text by storing first-letter to remaining text associations in a
hash map, managed by methods in RenderBoxModelObject.
