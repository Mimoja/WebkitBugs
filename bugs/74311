Crash due to incorrect parsing of isolates
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74311
When <bdi> content is wrapped, all hell breaks loose
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74396

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2011-12-14
Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Source/WebCore:

When an isolate was encountered during run layout, the entire isolate
would be parsed, even if the run started in the middle of the isolate.
This would sometimes cause parts of the isolate to be added multiple
times as runs. This patch marks the starting position within the
isolate so nothing is parsed twice.

This patch changes appendRun() so that when a run is added that is
inside an isolate, it saves the start position of the run rather than
the root. This allows constructBidiRuns() to resume parsing the
isolate from the correct position.

The change to RenderBox partially reverts a previous change I had
done. It makes sense to screen for the condition, as was previously
the case.

This patch does not add the test case from 74396 because a separate
bug is preventing it from rendering correctly.

* rendering/InlineIterator.h:
(WebCore::addPlaceholderRunForIsolatedInline)
(WebCore::IsolateTracker::addFakeRunIfNecessary)
(WebCore::InlineBidiResolver::appendRun)
* rendering/RenderBlockLineLayout.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlockLineLayout::constructBidiRuns)
* rendering/RenderBox.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBox::positionLineBox)

LayoutTests:

Layout test has multiple lines inside an isolate to ensure each run
is created only once.

The test that is in bug 74396 will have to be added once bug 74489 is
fixed.
