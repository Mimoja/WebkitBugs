When a child float is removed, the parent needs to ensure any reference to the
child is also removed from the floating objects list in any sibling block that
it intruded into.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::markSiblingsWithFloatsForLayout):
* rendering/RenderBox.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBox::removeFloatingOrPositionedChildFromBlockLists):

LayoutTests:

In multiple-captions-crash3.html a floating object is added as a child to a caption element, then removed and
added as a child to another caption element. When added to the first caption element it is added
to the floating objects list of both the parent tbody element and the keygen element, as it intrudes
into the latter. When removed, a stale reference to the floating object remains in the keygen element.
When the keygen element is in layout it attempts to access the stale reference to the floating object and
crashes. The fix is to ensure that any floats added as intruding floats to sibling blocks are removed
when the child is removed from the tree.

multiple-captions-crash4.html and multiple-captions-crash5.html are variants of this scenario.
