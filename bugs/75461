Crash from removal of line break object after layout
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75461

Source/WebCore:

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-04-26
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

There is a condition where objects can get removed from underneath
inlines while they represent a line break object in a RootInlineBox
of an ancestor block. If an intermediary inline has already been
marked as needing layout, then the line box will not get dirtied
because dirtyLineFromChangedChild thinks it already has been.

This patch introduces a new set in RenderObject to indicate whether
an ancestral line box corresponding to the current line has been
marked dirty or not. dirtyLinesFromChangedChild() can use this set
rather than m_selfNeedsLayout, so it will not be confused if a
container was dirtied for some other reason that did not affect the
line box.

* rendering/RenderLineBoxList.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderLineBoxList::dirtyLinesFromChangedChild): Use the new
set rather than m_selfNeedsLayout in the container to determine
whether to continue propagating upward.
* rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObject::s_ancestorLineboxDirtySet): Instantiate the
static member.
(WebCore::RenderObject::willBeDestroyed): Clears the object from the
linebox set when it is being destroyed.
* rendering/RenderObject.h:
(WebCore::RenderObject::s_ancestorLineboxDirtySet): Added static
member set.
(WebCore::RenderObject::setNeedsLayout): Clears the
object from the linebox set when layout bits are getting cleared.
(WebCore::RenderObject::ancestorLineBoxDirty): Added.
(WebCore::RenderObject::setAncestorLineBoxDirty): Added.
