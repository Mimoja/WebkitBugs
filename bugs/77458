Crash when reparenting children of flexible boxes
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77458

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-02-04
Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

Source/WebCore:

This fixes some regressions I introduced in r106150. RenderBlock::
removeChild needs to be careful about not collapsing anonymous
blocks underneath flexible boxes, and also about node ordering
when there is an after block.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::removeChild):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::collapseAnonymousBoxChild):

LayoutTests:

This test case reparents a block node from under a flexible box so
that only anonymous blocks and floating generated blocks remain.
A recent patch caused these anonymous blocks to be collapsed, which
is incorrect.
