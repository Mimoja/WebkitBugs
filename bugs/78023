RenderQuote must destroy remaining text renderer before first letter renderer

Source/WebCore:

Following the fix for <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114586>, a
RenderQuote may have child render objects for the first letter of its text
and everything following the first letter so as to support the CSS first-
letter property. The latter renderer is responsible for destroying the former
on destruction. It's sufficient to reverse the destruction of the children of
RenderQuote to ensure that we destroy the remaining text renderer before we
destroy the first letter renderer.
