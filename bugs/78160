Source/WebCore: Incorrect children placement in multi-column layout.

Test: fast/multicol/span/clone-before-after-content-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::clone): no longer need to take care of making
children noninline (remove fix r105769) since moveChild functions take
care of adding the child properly if type of children differ. this
function just makes sure to set the right value of childrenInline property.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::splitBlocks): similar to moveChild functions below.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveChildTo): when child is fullRemoveInsert (across
different parents, e.g clones), we should use addChild function to make sure
it handles the case of different type of children between fromBlock and
toBlock correctly (specifically making children non-inline/wrapping inline
children under anonymous blocks.).
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveChildrenTo):
* rendering/RenderBlock.h:
(RenderBlock):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveAllChildrenTo): Rename to->toBlock.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveChildrenTo): Rename to->toBlock.
