* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::splitAnonymousBlocksAroundChild): add
call to splitTablePartsAroundChild to take care of splitting the
table first if the child is part of table.
(WebCore::markTableForSectionAndCellRecalculation): add helper to
mark table for complete relayout by invalidating sections and cells.
(WebCore):
(WebCore::moveAllTableChildrenTo): moves children to another table.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::splitTablePartsAroundChild): split table child
and its next siblings into a new table. This allows adding a new
non-table child between the tables.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks): calls
splitTablePartsAroundChild to see if we need to split the table
for adding this new child.
* rendering/RenderBlock.h:
(RenderBlock):
* rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObject::createAnonymousTable): add helper for
creating anonymous table.
(WebCore):
(WebCore::RenderObject::addChild): use the new helper for creating
anonymous table.
* rendering/RenderObject.h:
(WebCore):
(RenderObject):
(WebCore::RenderObject::isTablePart): add helper to tell if the object
is a table part.

LayoutTests:

Test passes if the div child splits the table parts and is not
part of table itself.
