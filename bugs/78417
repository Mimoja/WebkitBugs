Crash due to accessing removed continuation in multi-column layout.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78417

Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

This patch addresses two problems:
1. Run-in block got split due to addition of a column-span child.
The clone part was incorrectly intruding into the sibling block,
even when it was part of the continuation chain.
2. Like r73296, we don't need to set continuation on an
anonymous block since we haven't split a real element.

Test: fast/multicol/span/runin-continuation-crash.html

(WebCore::RenderBlock::addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::handleRunInChild):

LayoutTests:
