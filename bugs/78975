Invalid cast in WebCore::toElement / WebCore::HTMLElementStack::ElementRecord::element
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=78975

Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Source/WebCore:

We're supposed to set the action attribute on the form element we just
created.  Previously, we assumed the newly created form element would
be on the top of the stack of open elements, but if we're in the table
body insertion mode, the form element gets treated as self closing and
is therefore popped off the stack of open elements.

Fortunately, we already cache a pointer to the most recently inserted
form element on the HTMLConstructionSite, so we can just grab the
element from there.
