Crash due to accessing removed parent lineboxes when clearing selection.

Reviewed by Dave Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

Test: editing/selection/first-letter-selection-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBoxModelObject.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::setSelectionState):
1. No need of checking if we are being set to same selection state.
Now tested by setSelectionStateIfNeeded. Rename 's' with 'state' and
'cb' with 'containingBlock'.
* rendering/RenderListMarker.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderListMarker::setSelectionState):
1. Add check to canUpdateSelectionOnRootLineBoxes to make sure our
root line boxes are still valid before setting them.
2. No need of calling setSelectionState on containing block since our base
class call to RenderBox::setSelectionState covers it. Added a comment to indicate that.
3. Use m_inlineBoxWrapper variable directly to simplify the ifs.
* rendering/RenderObject.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObject::canUpdateSelectionOnRootLineBoxes):
(WebCore): helper function to tell if we can update selection information
on our root line boxes. This returns false if our containing block is pending layout.
* rendering/RenderObject.h:
(RenderObject):
(WebCore::RenderObject::setSelectionStateIfNeeded):
(WebCore): helper to set selection state only if it is different from our
current selection state.
* rendering/RenderReplaced.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderReplaced::setSelectionState):
1. Rename 's' to 'state', 'line' to 'root' and use m_inlineBoxWrapper directly
to simplify ifs.
2. Add check to canUpdateSelectionOnRootLineBoxes to make sure our
root line boxes are still valid before setting them.
* rendering/RenderText.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderText::setSelectionState):
1. Add check to canUpdateSelectionOnRootLineBoxes to make sure our
root line boxes are still valid before setting them.
2. Rename 'cb' to 'containingBlock', 'line' to 'root', move InlineTextBox
declaration to local.
* rendering/RenderView.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderView::setSelection): Replace all calls to setSelectionState
with setSelectionStateIfNeeded.
* rendering/RenderWidget.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderWidget::setSelectionState):
1. No need of checking if we are being set to same selection state.
Now tested by setSelectionStateIfNeeded.

LayoutTests:

* editing/selection/first-letter-selection-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* editing/selection/first-letter-selection-crash.html: Added.
