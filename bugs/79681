Crash when changing list marker locations
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79681

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-02-29
Reviewed by David Hyatt.

Source/WebCore:

This fixes a regression crash from r108548.

There are some conditions where removing the anonymous block
parent at that point can cause problems. One is when there is
a continuation from it, and another when it is a sibling of
lineBoxParent and it causes lineBoxParent to be deleted
incidentally. This patch delays the destruction until after
lineBoxParent has been used and makes an exception for
continuations.

* rendering/RenderListItem.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderListItem::updateMarkerLocation)

LayoutTests:

This test exercises the crashing condition for bug 79681 where an
anonymous block was being removed from the render tree inappropriately.
