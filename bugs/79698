Heap-use-after-free in WebCore::RenderLayer::addChild

Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

Source/WebCore:

This patch fixes a regression introduced in r108659.
The reflection layer was moved to the parent by mistake. It was then
deleted and the parent was left holding on to a deleted pointer. This
patch restores the location where reflection layer is removed - before
moving the child layers.

Test: fast/reflections/toggle-reflection-crash.html

* rendering/RenderLayer.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderLayer::removeOnlyThisLayer):

LayoutTests:

* fast/reflections/toggle-reflection-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/reflections/toggle-reflection-crash.html: Added.
