Crash from list marker having inline and block children
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79793

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-02-28
Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

Crashing condition in which an anonymous block was being collapsed
even though it had a block sibling. removeChild() was not checking
for siblings that might precede :before content renderers, such
as list items. This patch corrects that.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::removeChild)

LayoutTests:

Test to exercise crashing condition in bug 79793. This creates a list
marker that precedes a floating :before content renderer and then
modifies the render tree to remove a neighboring header element.
