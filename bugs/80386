Assert in checkValidity() in hashtable.h from WebGeolocationManager::didFailToDeterminePosition() when fetching http://html5demos.com/geo
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80386

Patch by Benjamin Poulain <bpoulain@apple.com> on 2012-08-05
Reviewed by Alexey Proskuryakov.

Source/WebKit2: 

WebKit2's WebGeolocationManager was delivering events without accounting that each event
can modify the list of page that need delivery.
Any page can remove itself by invoking clearWatch() from the callback function. A page can also cause another
page to be removed.

This patch solves the issue by taking a copy of the list of page before delivery. Each page is
referenced as it can be deleted during the delivery.

Unfortunately, this cannot be tested due to missing features of WebKitTestRunner.

* WebProcess/Geolocation/WebGeolocationManager.cpp:
(WebKit::WebGeolocationManager::didChangePosition):
(WebKit::WebGeolocationManager::didFailToDeterminePosition):

LayoutTests: 

Add tests for clearing the Geolocation as a listener from a callback originated from the GeolocationController.
