Crash in WebCore::SVGUseElement::instanceForShadowTreeElement
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80406

Reviewed by Nikolas Zimmermann.

Code assumes that an object that is an SVG Element and in a shadow
tree must be in an SVG use shadow tree, and casts the shadow host with
a static_cast. It may be that an SVG element appears in a non-use
shadow tree, in which case bad things happen. While it appears that
the current code prevents such a situation from arising (checks are
made within the shadow tree code to prevent it) there are also
indications that the situation may change.

No new tests. I believe that the problem here cannot currently be
reproduced. That is, other code prevents SVG elements from appearing
in non-svg shadow trees.
