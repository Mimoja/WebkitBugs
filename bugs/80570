ContainerNode::insertedIntoTree and removedFromTree use weak iteration patterns
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80570

Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

These functions use weak iteration patterns, but as far as I can tell,
we never execute script below these functions.  This patch adds ASSERTs
to help us avoid adding events in the future.

* dom/ContainerNode.cpp:
(WebCore::ContainerNode::insertedIntoTree):
(WebCore::ContainerNode::removedFromTree):
* html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::loadInternal):
    - There's a somewhat complex call chain from insertedIntoTree into
      HTMLMediaElement, and somewhat complex control flow below
      loadInternal that eventually leads to the BeforeLoad event being
      fired.  In studying this code, I don't see a way for the
      BeforeLoad event to be fired during insertedIntoTree, but I've
      added this assert here to make sure we don't call loadInternal
      when we're not supposed to dispatch events.  This ASSERT should
      help us catch these BeforeLoad errors more quickly.
