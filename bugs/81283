https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112235

Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

Similar to https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81283, but the
fix to that bug failed to cover this particular comma-splicing case.

Test: http/tests/security/xssAuditor/img-tag-with-comma.html

* html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp:
(WebCore::isTerminatingCharacter):
Beware of comma-splicing tricks by stopping at commas.

LayoutTests:

* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/img-tag-with-comma-expected.txt: Added.
* http/tests/security/xssAuditor/img-tag-with-comma.html: Added.
