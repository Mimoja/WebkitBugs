<select> shouldn't intrude as a run-in.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82829

Reviewed by Tony Chang.

Source/WebCore:

Matches Opera's behavior which also does not allow <select>
to intrude as a run-in into the neighbouring block.
IE and Firefox doesn't support run-ins, so can't compare behavior
with them.

Test: fast/runin/select-runin.html

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::handleRunInChild):

LayoutTests:

* fast/runin/select-runin-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/runin/select-runin.html: Added.
