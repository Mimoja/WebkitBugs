Notify observers of WorkerRunLoop stopping before the V8 isolate dies.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83104

Source/WebCore:

PlatformSupport::didStopWorkerRunLoop ultimately causes
~V8AbstractEventListener to call
v8::Local<v8::Object>::New(m_listener) after the V8 isolate has been
disposed, which manifests as a crash in V8.

The current code in trunk runs this at shutdown:
1) removeAllDOMObjects()
2) dispose of V8
3) didStopWorkerRunLoop()  <-- problem

This patch changes the order to be:
1) removeAllDOMObjects()
2) didStopWorkerRunLoop()
3) dispose of V8

We put didStopWorkerRunLoop after removeAllDOMObjects because we don't
want chromium code that runs on a webcore worker to run after it
receives the didStopWorkerRunLoop signal. The destructors of some IDB
objects are run by removeAllDOMObjects, so putting
didStopWorkerRunLoop before removeAllDOMObjects would violate that
constraint.

It's possible that there's a lower layer fix available in V8 or the
bindings.

* bindings/v8/WorkerScriptController.cpp:
(WebCore::WorkerScriptController::~WorkerScriptController):
New location of didStopWorkerRunLoop. removeAllDOMObjects and V8
disposal are called here, to run something between them it also has
to go here.

* workers/WorkerThread.cpp:
(WebCore::WorkerThread::workerThread): Old location of
didStopWorkerRunLoop.
