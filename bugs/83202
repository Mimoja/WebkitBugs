WorkerEventQueue::close might access deleted WorkerEventQueue::EventDispatcherTask.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83202

On closing the event queue, WorkerEventQueue cancels all the tasks associated with events.
The tasks in their turn delete themselves from the map whenever task gets executed.
However if shutdown occurs when task is in queue but before task gets executed, the task will be deleted without execution.
This patch makes sure that no deleted tasks stay in WorkerEventQueue, by task removing itself in destructor.

Covered by existing tests.
