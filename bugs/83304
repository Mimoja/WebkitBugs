Crash in MutationObservers due to an invalid HashSet iterator
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83304

Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

Source/WebCore:

If the observed node has been GCed when we clear transient observers
from it, the HashSet iterator in WebKitMutationObserver::deliver would
be invalidated. This patch fixes that behavior by copying the relevant
registrations into a seperate vector first and operating on the copy.

This patch also fixes a bug: transient observers should be cleared
after every microtask, not just when delivering.

Tests: fast/mutation/clear-transient-without-delivery.html
       fast/mutation/transient-gc-crash.html

* dom/MutationObserverRegistration.cpp:
(WebCore::MutationObserverRegistration::observedSubtreeNodeWillDetach):
Notify the observer that it has a transient registration so it can be properly cleared.
* dom/MutationObserverRegistration.h:
(WebCore::MutationObserverRegistration::hasTransientRegistrations):
Add an accessor for use when deliver() creates its vector of registrations.
* dom/WebKitMutationObserver.cpp:
(WebCore::WebKitMutationObserver::setHasTransientRegistration): Add this to the active observer set
to allow transient registrations to be cleared appropriately.
(WebCore::WebKitMutationObserver::deliver): Avoid modifying m_registrations while iterating over it.
Clear registrations before checking for a lack of records to deliver.
* dom/WebKitMutationObserver.h:
