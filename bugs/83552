Crash due to captions list not updated after section recalc.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83552

Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

Test: fast/table/table-caption-not-removed-crash.html

* rendering/RenderTable.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderTable::addChild): no need to set the need for
section recalc. It was needed in old code when we had more than
one caption and we need to call section recalc to destroy the other
captions.
(WebCore::RenderTable::recalcSections): need to rebuild captions list.
This is how the old code worked before r100177. Basically, children can
moved without calling RenderTable::removeChild, so we should depend on
recalcSections to update our captions list. Also, fix a style nit of aligning
case labels with the switch statement.

LayoutTests:
