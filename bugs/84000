Regression(114172): Use after free in CustomFilterProgram::notifyClients
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84000

Reviewed by Dean Jackson.

The function returned early and the shaders didn't have a chance to be saved. Moving
those two lines before the return false just to make sure that FilterEffectRenderer never adds
itself as a client for a shader without keeping track of that.

No new tests. The problem reproduces with existing tests.
