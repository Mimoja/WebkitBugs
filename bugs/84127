ShadowRoot shouldn't be adopted by any Document.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84127

Reviewed by Dimitri Glazkov.

Source/WebCore:

ShadowRoot cannot cannot be removed from its host, which means
ShadowRoot cannot be adopted by any Document directly because the
adoptNode() tries to remove it from its parent but it doesn't make
sense for ShadowRoot.

This change adds a guard to check such a case.

Test: fast/dom/shadow/adopt-node-with-shadow-root.html

* dom/Document.cpp:
(WebCore::Document::adoptNode):

LayoutTests:

* fast/dom/shadow/adopt-node-with-shadow-root-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/dom/shadow/adopt-node-with-shadow-root.html: Added.
