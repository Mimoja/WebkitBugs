Positioned children of ruby runs not handled correctly during layout
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84157

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-04-19
Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

A positioned ruby text causes a problem because it is excluded from
normal layout by its parent and instead gets layout from
RenderRubyRun::layoutSpecialExcludedChild; however this means it gets
skipped over during the loop in RenderBlock::layoutBlockChildren,
which is where positioned RenderBlocks get added to the appropriate
positioned object lists. As a result, a dirty positioned ruby text
will not get layout again unless the RenderRubyRun also needs layout
which is not guaranteed.

This patch disqualifies ruby text elements from being positioned.
If it is necessary to support this in future, ruby text layout will
have to be modified to ensure the renderers are added to the
appropriate block lists.

LayoutTests:

* fast/ruby/modify-positioned-ruby-text-crash-expected.txt: Added
* fast/ruby/modify-positioned-ruby-text-crash.html: Exercises the crash condition
in but 84157 relating to positioned ruby text. This is being added
in case support for positioned ruby text is added in future, so that
we can guard against regression.
* fast/ruby/floating-ruby-text-expected.png: Added
* fast/ruby/floating-ruby-text-expected.txt: Added
* fast/ruby/floating-ruby-text.html: Creates a positioned ruby text. The
position should be ignored.
* fast/ruby/positioned-ruby-text-expected.png: Added
* fast/ruby/positioned-ruby-text-expected.txt: Added
* fast/ruby/positioned-ruby-text.html: Creates a floating ruby text. The
float should be ignored.
