Patch by David Barton <dbarton@mathscribe.com> on 2012-05-11
Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

Change RenderMathMLFenced::addChild() to use the beforeChild parameter. When beforeChild
is 0, insert child renderers before the closing fence, which might not be the same as
this->lastChild(), e.g. possibly due to anonymous blocks or generated content.
