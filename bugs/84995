Crash in InsertParagraphSeparatorCommand::doApply.

Source/WebCore:

Test: editing/inserting/insert-paragraph-seperator-crash.html

* editing/DeleteSelectionCommand.cpp:
(WebCore::DeleteSelectionCommand::mergeParagraphs): no need of static cast, since
type of enclosingBlock returned is already Element*.
* editing/IndentOutdentCommand.cpp:
(WebCore::IndentOutdentCommand::tryIndentingAsListItem): no need of static cast, since
type of enclosingBlock returned is already Element*.
* editing/InsertParagraphSeparatorCommand.cpp:
(WebCore::InsertParagraphSeparatorCommand::doApply): RefPtr startBlock to guard against
mutation events.
* editing/htmlediting.cpp:
(WebCore::enclosingBlock): make sure type of enclosingNode is an element before doing
the static cast. This was already failing in a couple of layout tests. Also, isBlock
check already exists in the function call to enclosingNodeOfType, so don't need it
again on enclosingNode's renderer.
* editing/htmlediting.h:
(WebCore):

LayoutTests:

* editing/inserting/insert-paragraph-seperator-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* editing/inserting/insert-paragraph-seperator-crash.html: Added.
