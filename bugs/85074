Crash due to positioned object list not being cleared during block flow split
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85074

Patch by Ken Buchanan <kenrb@chromium.org> on 2012-05-07
Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

When an element is being split due to a column span element being
inserted, any of its ancestors that are underneath the column
containing block also get split. If an ancestor has an object in
its positioned object list from a previous layout, then the list
will have to be cleared because the positioned object could have moved
to be under the continuation. This patch causes the list to be
cleared.

(WebCore::RenderBlock::splitBlocks):

LayoutTests:

Test exercises crashing condition in bug 85074. It creates a column
span that requires multiple layers of splitting blocks from the
element that contains the columns, puts a positioned element underneath
one of the split blocks, and then causes a reattach of the column span
element.
