Source/WebCore:

This bug was caused by Length not understanding that calc expressions shouldn't be
blended - a Length with a calc expression handle was created without incrementing
the ref count of the expression. Length no longer attempts to blend calc expressions,
http://webkit.org/b/86160 has been filed to track expression blending. Fixing this fixed
the crash.

Once this was fixed, the RenderStyle diff checker thought the style was changing,
as Length didn't know how to compare calc expressions, resulting in an infinite
loop of style recalcs. Expressions can now compare themselves.
