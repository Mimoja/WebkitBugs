Region reads past end of spans
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85909

Reviewed by Anders Carlsson.

Source/WebCore:

Region currently checks aSpan == aSpanEnd as the indicator that
we passed all the spans. When aSpan < aSpanEnd, it uses aSpan+1
to find the height of the span.

If aSpan == aSpanEnd - 1, then aSpan+1 == aSpanEnd. This does not
represent a valid span, since aSpanEnd is past the end of the
array, not the last element in the array. The loop should terminate
in this case.

Checking aSegment != aSegmentEnd is acceptable in the inner loop since
it increments by two each time (segments come in pairs, while spans
come in singles).
