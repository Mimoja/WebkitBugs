MediaStream API: Fix a reference counting issue in UserMediaRequest
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86210

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

* ManualTests/user-media-request-crash.html: Added.

Source/WebCore:

When contextDestroyed() is called on UserMediaRequest it does a callback to the
page client. If the receiving code clears their stored copy the UserMediaRequest
object is destroyed in the middle of the call.

Currently only testable manually against chrome, preferably with asan turned on.
I have added a manual test that verifies the fix, but I have started work
