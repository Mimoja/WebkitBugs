Move run-in handling to addChild, instead of in layout.

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::addChildIgnoringAnonymousColumnBlocks): handle run-ins here
instead of layout. We do run-in handling when we see a new child with run-in display
or add a new block whose previous sibling is run-in.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::makeChildrenNonInline): if we will have block children, need
to move run-in back to its original position.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::handleSpecialChild): no longer need to handle run-ins during layout.
(WebCore::destroyRunIn): helper to destroy a block or inline run-in.
(WebCore):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::createReplacementRunIn): helper to create the new replacement run-in.
For moveRunInUnderSiblingBlockIfNeeded, it will be used to create a new inline run-in
that goes into the next sibling block. For moveRunInToOriginalPosition, it creates a new
block run-in that goes back to where it came from.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveRunInUnderSiblingBlockIfNeeded): almost same as previous
handleRunInChild function, but with the return type removed. Also, we don't allow
a run-in to intrude into a block that already has a run-in.
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveRunInToOriginalPosition): moves run-in back to where it came from.
* rendering/RenderBlock.h:
(RenderBlock):
* rendering/RenderBox.cpp:
* rendering/RenderBox.h:
(RenderBox):
* rendering/RenderBoxModelObject.cpp: move all moveChild* functions from RenderBox, since
they can now be used to move children of inlines.
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::moveChildTo): same.
(WebCore):
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::moveChildrenTo): same.
* rendering/RenderBoxModelObject.h:
(RenderBoxModelObject):
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::moveChildTo): same.
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::moveAllChildrenTo): same.
(WebCore::RenderBoxModelObject::moveChildrenTo): same.

LayoutTests:

The following tests need the render tree results as they help
to show the positioning of the run-in with respect to the next
sibling block.
