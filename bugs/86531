This was broken by r117333, which was an attempt to avoid memory errors
on GIFs that were malformed in a similar way.  It turns out some GIFs
in the wild (i.e. "our LayoutTests directory") relied on some of the
effects of the old code.  This refixes in a way that doesn't break
these.

No new tests, covered by existing tests.
