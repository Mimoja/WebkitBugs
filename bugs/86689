CachedImage does not clear the ImageObserver pointer when dropping its Image ref
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86689

Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Image instances keep a weak pointer to their ImageObserver, which may be null. CachedImage is an ImageObserver
and holds a RefPtr<Image> m_image. When CachedImage initializes its m_image to either an SVGImage or BitmapImage,
it sets itself as that Image's ImageObserver. However, CachedImage never clears the ImageObserver pointer, even
when dropping its reference to the Image. This means if other code holds a RefPtr<Image> there is no promise
that calls on that Image will be valid. This patch clears the CachedImage::m_image's ImageObserver pointer
whenever the CachedImage drops its reference. Image already has null checks for its m_imageObserver so this is
always a safe operation.
