Crash in run-ins with continuations while moving back to original position.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87264

Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

Run-in that are now placed in sibling block can break up into continuation
chains when new children are added to it. We cannot easily send them back to their
original place since that requires writing integration logic with RenderInline::addChild
and all other places that might cause continuations to be created (without blowing away
|this|). Disabling this feature for now to prevent crashes.

Test: fast/runin/runin-continuations-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::moveRunInToOriginalPosition):
