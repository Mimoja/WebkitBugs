Avoid creating InlineBoxes for floating and positioned objects in isolates.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87277

Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Source/WebCore:

We currently will create a placeholder run for the first object we encounter inside an isolate. Then
in RenderBlockLineLayout's constructBidiRuns, we replace that run with the contents of the Isolate.
We run into problems when there are no valid contents in the Isolate. We can't simply remove the
placeholder if there's nothing to replace it with since it may be the logically last run, which we
track but can't rebuild by the time we're handling isolates (we've already shuffled the BidiRuns around).

With this change, we avoid creating a placeholder altogether until we hit contents in the isolate
that would warrant a BidiRun in the first place.
