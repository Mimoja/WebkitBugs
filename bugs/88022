Crash in multi-column layout.

Reviewed by Ojan Vafai.

Source/WebCore:

The patch addresses two problems::
1. |this| in RenderBlock::splitBlocks can get destroyed when we
move its children to the clone and later call updateBeforeAfterContent
on the parent. So, we stop accessing its member variables and cache
it in a local.
2. Positioned objects were not getting cleared from our grand parents.
This will happen if our immediate children got moved to a clone tree,
however at our parent nothing was moved. So, we make sure to remove
the positioned objects at every level while we are doing the cloning.
