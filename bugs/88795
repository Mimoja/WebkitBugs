Crash in InlineFlowBox::deleteLine.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88795

Reviewed by Tony Chang.

Source/WebCore:

When we move the fullscreen object from its parent to RenderFullScreen, we forgot to clear the
line box tree underneath the object's containing block and mark it for layout. Before the patch,
the containing block never got laid out and maintained references to removed line boxes (since the
object moved under RenderFullScreen did get laid out and its lineboxes replaced with new ones).

Test: fullscreen/full-screen-line-boxes-crash.html

* rendering/RenderFullScreen.cpp:
(RenderFullScreen::wrapRenderer):

LayoutTests:

* fullscreen/full-screen-line-boxes-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fullscreen/full-screen-line-boxes-crash.html: Added.
