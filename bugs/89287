-webkit-background-clip:text produces artifacts when applied to the body and the browser is resized
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89287

Reviewed by Beth Dakin.

Source/WebCore:

If the body had -webkit-background-clip: text, we'd fail to paint
anything behind it, so would see garbage pixels.

Fix by having RenderView::paintBoxDecorations() check for a background-clip of "text"
on the renderer that paints the root background.

Added some new pixel tests for combinations of html and body transform
and backgrounds; earlier versions of the patch broke some of these tests.

Tests: fast/backgrounds/background-clip-text-on-body.html
       fast/backgrounds/transformed-body-background.html
       fast/backgrounds/transformed-body-html-background.html
       fast/backgrounds/transformed-html-body-background.html

* rendering/RenderView.cpp:
(WebCore::rendererObscuresBackground): Broke up the single condition
into early 'false' returns when possible. We need to also check whether
the renderer that actually paints the background (which might be the body)
will fill it; background-clip: text does not.
(WebCore::RenderView::paintBoxDecorations): Rather than checking firstChild(),
actually check the root renderer, so that we can reliably get to the renderer
that mains the root background.

LayoutTests:

Test with -webkit-background-clip: text on the body, which scrolls.

Some additional tests that exercise different combinations of html and
body transform and background.
