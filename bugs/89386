Crash in RenderInline::willBeDestroyed.

Reviewed by Julien Chaffraix.

Source/WebCore:

We were unable to find the previous continuation during the process
of cleaning up empty anonymous block continuation. The reason being
that we were just looking till our immediate parent and ignoring the
fact that it can be enclosed in anonymous blocks. The change skips
over anonymous blocks in the parent chain.

Test: fullscreen/empty-anonymous-block-continuation-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBlock.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBlock::removeChild):

LayoutTests:

* fullscreen/empty-anonymous-block-continuation-crash-expected.txt: Added.
