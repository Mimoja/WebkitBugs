Prevent crash in animate resource handling
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90042

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

This patch adds a check that we are in a document before registering animation
resources and creating a target element in SVGSMILElement. This prevents a crash where
we would register resources and create the target when we were not in a document
but fail to deregister / reset the target when we were removed from a document.
In failing to reset the target, we can crash when trying to deregister resources that
were not created after being inserted into a document and then removed.

The existence of m_targetResources and registered animation resources is now
tied to being in a document.
