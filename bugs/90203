Add preventative assert in SVGTRefElement
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90203

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

SVGTRefElement::detachTarget() adds a pending resource via addPendingResource.
Due to some recent bugs in this area, an assert is being added to prevent
users from calling detachTarget when not in a document. Doing
so would create a bug such as in WK90042.

This assert will not fire currently because detachTarget is only called after
a DOMNodeRemovedFromDocumentEvent event fires, which only comes from
dispatchChildRemovalEvents when the node is in a document.
