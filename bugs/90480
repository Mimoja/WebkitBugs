Reviewed by Kent Tamura.

Source/WebCore:

If <select> has any insertion point, the attachment phase
unpextedly creates a renderer for distributed node and added to
the renderer of the <select>, which breaks an assumption and
results the crash.

This change tighten the childShouldCreateRenderer() to forbid
child renderers even from distributed nodes.

There is an exception as always: ValidationMessage can create a
ShadowRoot to <select>, which generates usually-forbidden child
renderers.  This change introduces HTMLFormControlElement::validationMessageContains()
to let these renderers in.
