Crash in nextLinePosition() due to accessing a removed root line box.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90484

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

When <object> element is reattached, the 'content' style is compared to the old style.
If it is not the same, a flag to recalc style is enabled. Because of this, the recalc style flag
is not cleared in updateLayoutIgnorePendingStyleSheets() in nextLinePosition(), and it causes
the second layout in isEditablePosition(p). Then 'RootInlineBox root' is invalidated, but
it's used after that.

When the content of the same <object> elements are compared, they should be the same.
However, operator== for ContentData is not implemented correctly (it compares a pointer instead of
content). So operator== does not hold for the content of the same <object> elements.

Test: editing/execCommand/crash-extend-selection-forward.html

* rendering/style/ContentData.cpp:
(WebCore::operator==): Compares the instance of data instead of pointer.

LayoutTests:

This testcase should not be triggered in ASAN.
