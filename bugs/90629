Multiple Content Security Policy headers are correctly processed as separate headers.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90629

Source/WebCore:

Headers of the same name are normalized into a single, comma-separated
string as per RFC2616, section 4.2. We didn't correctly account for this
in ContentSecurityPolicy::didReceiveHeader. Now we do by walking through
the header string, looking for commas and processing each block in turn.

This oversight bit Firefox as well, and was patched in February:
