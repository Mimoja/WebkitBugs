Crash due to SVG animation element not removed from target (before reset)
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90750

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

Previously we were not removing an animation element from
SVGDocumentExtensions::m_animatedElements which led to a crash.
This change properly removes animation elements in resetTargetElement
which both fixes this bug and will prevent others from hitting it in
the future.

Test: svg/animations/dynamic-modify-attributename-crash2.svg

* svg/SVGDocumentExtensions.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGDocumentExtensions::removeAllAnimationElementsFromTarget):

removeAllAnimationElementsFromTarget now adds all the animation elements
to a vector and iterates over it because the changes to resetTargetElement
would have caused us to modify the underlying hashset as we iterated. Note that
before we deleted animationElementsForTarget in removeAllAnimationElementsFromTarget
but that logic is now handled in removeAnimationElementFromTarget which is called
during resetTargetElement.

* svg/animation/SVGSMILElement.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGSMILElement::removedFrom):

Because of the changes in resetTargetElement, removedFrom was able to be
refactored. This patch changes removedFrom to call resetTargetElement rather
than have duplicated logic. There is a very small change in logic here:
animationAttributeChanged() is now called in removedFrom().

(WebCore::SVGSMILElement::resetTargetElement):

resetTargetElement now fully resets the target, including removing it from
m_animatedElements. This will prevent future instances of this bug.

LayoutTests:

* svg/animations/dynamic-modify-attributename-crash2-expected.txt: Added.
* svg/animations/dynamic-modify-attributename-crash2.svg: Added.
