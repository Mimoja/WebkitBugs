Crash after clicking in plugin at kauaiexplorer.com

Source/WebKit2:

Bug: Clicking the plugin to navigate away from the page caused the browser to crash.
     This is because it is possible for a beforeunload handler to destroy the plugin
     while it is still needed. In this case the handler set visibility to "none" and
     then accessed a property on the plugin script object. This forced a layout
     that destroyed the plugin.
Fix: Protecting PluginView objects until they are no longer required.
     This was done by adding a RefPtr at the beginning of performURLRequest()

* WebProcess/Plugins/PluginView.cpp:
(WebKit::PluginView::performURLRequest):
