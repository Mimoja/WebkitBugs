Crash in WebCore::RenderTable::cellBefore
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91160

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

The issue was that we wouldn't properly set the row index on row in a newly split table. When inserting
the cell into the new row, we would try to repaint the cell which would access the row index and crash.
This came from splitAnonymousBoxesAroundChild calling RenderObjectChildList::insertChildNode directly
which doesn't invoke the row setting logic (RenderTableSection::addChild for example but we cannot call
addChild due to concern over splitting flows in the general case).

Test: fast/table/split-anonymous-boxes-around-table-repaint-crash.html

* rendering/RenderBox.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderBox::splitAnonymousBoxesAroundChild):
Dirty our parent box, which forces a cell recomputation which will set the row index. This needs to
be done *before* we insert the child to avoid crashing when repainting the new child.
