CSSRegions: Crash when reattaching a region to a named flow.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91307

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

The lifetime of a flow thread  has changed from not being destroyed (until the RenderView is destroyed) to being destroyed,
under certain conditions, no attached regions and no content, before RenderView is destroyed.
When the flow thread does not have any content and the region to be detached is the last region for the flow thread,
the flow thread is destroyed.
In this case, if the same region has to be attached again to the flow thread, the flow thread needs to be
recreated, otherwise the crash will result.

Test: fast/regions/region-flow-reattach-crash.html

* rendering/RenderRegion.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderRegion::attachRegion):
We skip the attach if we are in the middle of document destruction.
We recreate the flow thread to which the region is intended to be attached only if the region was
not previously marked as invalid in relation to the flow thread (because the region was part of a
circular dependency).
(WebCore::RenderRegion::detachRegion): After the region is detached from flow thread,
null the region internal pointer to the flow thread to mark that the region is not
attached.

LayoutTests:

Test that after the last region from a flow thread is reattached
to the same flow thread, the flow thread object is properly recreated
thus preventing a crash.
