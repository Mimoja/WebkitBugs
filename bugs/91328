[chromium] Incorrect assertion: Replicas will cause a RenderPass to be removed twice
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91328

Reviewed by Adrienne Walker.

Source/WebCore:

We asserted that we would never attempt to remove a render pass that had
already been removed. This was incorrect as a surface with a replica has
two quads and both may cause us to attempt its removal. We must handle
this case gracefully.

Test: CCLayerTreeHostTestSurfaceNotAllocatedForLayersOutsideMemoryLimit

* platform/graphics/chromium/cc/CCLayerTreeHostImpl.cpp:
(WebCore::CCLayerTreeHostImpl::CullRenderPassesWithNoQuads::shouldRemoveRenderPass):

Source/WebKit/chromium:

Add replicas to the surfaces in the test.
