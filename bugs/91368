Crash on accessing a removed layout root in FrameView::scheduleRelayout.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91368

Reviewed by Levi Weintraub.

We were calling setNeedsLayoutAndPrefWidthsRecalc() in RenderBlock::collapseAnonymousBoxChild
even when documentBeingDestroyed() was true. This ends up accessing stale layout root and bypasses
mitigation added in r109406. There is no need to waste time merging up anonymous blocks in
RenderBlock::removeChild when documentBeingDestroyed() is true.

No new tests. The test is time sensitive, requires a bunch of reloads, and only reproduces on chromium linux.

(WebCore::RenderBlock::collapseAnonymousBoxChild):
(WebCore::RenderBlock::removeChild):
