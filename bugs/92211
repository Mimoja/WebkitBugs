WebCore::ScriptRunner::timerFired() is reported to crash.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92211

Reviewed by Darin Adler.

This is a speculative fix to address some crash reports.
Here is my rough guess.

The crash report says there is a PendingScript instance whose m_element is null.
- It happens only if the instance is created through the default constructor,
- that could happen if m_pendingAsyncScripts doesn't contains matched PendingScript in ScriptRunner::notifyScriptReady(),
- that could happen when notifyScriptReady() is called more than once.
- It turns out that the call site, ScriptElement::notifyFinished(), could be called multiple times since
  it doesn't remove itself from the CachedResource, which is done separately in ScriptElement::execute().
- So if notifyFinished() is called before execute(), it could happen

This change added a guard to prevent notifyFinished() from being invoked multiple times.
We should watch if these crash reports disappear.

No new tests. I couldn't create any repro for this.
