Heap-use-after-free in WebCore::StyleResolver::loadPendingImage
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92606

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

Changes StyleResolver's m_pendingImageProperties set to a map, such that for each property we keep
a RefPtr to the CSSValue used to set that property. This ensures that CSSValues are not freed before
they are needed by loadPendingImage.

Test: fast/css/variables/deferred-image-load-from-variable.html
