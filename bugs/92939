Negative timestamps for TextTrackCues should not be allowed.

Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

Make sure cues added in JavaScript are not allowed negative timestamps.
Attempting to add a cue with a negative timestamp is not successful
and setting a timestamp to a negative value has no effect.

Source/WebCore:

Test: media/track/track-cue-negative-timestamp.html

* html/track/TextTrack.cpp:
(WebCore::TextTrack::addCue): If the cue's startTime or endTime is
    negative, do not add the cue.

(WebCore::TextTrackCue::setStartTime): Ignore negative values.
(WebCore::TextTrackCue::setEndTime): Ignore negative values.
* html/track/TextTrackCueList.cpp:
(WebCore::TextTrackCueList::add): Add ASSERTs to check startTime and
    endTime are positive.
