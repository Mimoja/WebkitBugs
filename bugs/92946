https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92946

Reviewed by Eric Carlson.

Source/WebCore:

In GenericEventQueue::timerFired(), the owner of GenericEventQueue might be deleted.
We have to protect the owner of GenericEventQueue during dispatching events.

Test: media/event-queue-crash.html

* dom/GenericEventQueue.cpp:
(WebCore::GenericEventQueue::timerFired): Added a protection.

LayoutTests:

* media/event-queue-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* media/event-queue-crash.html: Added.
