Crash when a clip path referencing a clip path changes documents
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93023

Reviewed by Dirk Schulze.

Source/WebCore: 

The SVGClipPathElement is set to not need pending resource handling,
when in fact it can have pending resources. The result is a crash when
the element is moved to a new document (which deletes all resources
and leaves them pending) and then immediately deleted (which asserts
that there are no pending resources). There is code to remove pending
resources upon deletion and removal from the DOM, but it was not
executing for clips because of the aforementioned code claiming that
clips don't require such handling.

The assertion that there be no pending resources is necessary to
prevent caches of pending resources from trying to access the deleted
element.

This change removes the check for needsPendingResourceHandling in
SVGStyledElement upon deletion and removal from the DOM. Pending resources
will always be checked in such cases to ensure we do not introduce
security issues.

Test: svg/custom/clip-path-document-change-assert.html

* svg/SVGStyledElement.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGStyledElement::~SVGStyledElement): Removed needsPendingResourceHandling in the conditional to clean up resources.
(WebCore::SVGStyledElement::removedFrom): Removed needsPendingResourceHandling in the conditional to clean up resources.

LayoutTests: 

Test that asserts in debug DRT without this change. Any attempt to
delete a clip that references another clip after changing the document
results in a crash.

* svg/custom/clip-path-document-change-assert-expected.txt: Added.
* svg/custom/clip-path-document-change-assert.html: Added.
