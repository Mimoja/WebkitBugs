DOMCharacterDataModified should not be fired inside shadows
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93427

Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

Source/WebCore:

CharacterData::dispatchModifiedEvent() fires DOMCharacterDataModified event even if
the node is in shadow. But it shouldn't. Check dispatchChildInsertionEvents() and
dispatchChildRemovalEvents() to see how other MutationEvents are suppressed behind shadows.
This change follows the same path to suppress DOMCharacterDataModified.

Tests: fast/dom/shadow/suppress-mutation-events-in-shadow-characterdata.html
       fast/forms/textarea-and-mutation-events-appending-text.html

* dom/CharacterData.cpp:
(WebCore::CharacterData::dispatchModifiedEvent):

LayoutTests:

Added two tests. This also fixes existing test, which cover the wrong behavior.

* fast/dom/shadow/suppress-mutation-events-in-shadow-characterdata-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/dom/shadow/suppress-mutation-events-in-shadow-characterdata.html: Added.
* fast/events/dom-character-data-modified-textarea-crash.html:
- DOMCharacterDataModified shouldn't be fired in this case.
  Fixed to allow test to terminate without the event.
  Note that The event was fired by <textarea>, which is fixed by this change.
* fast/forms/textarea-and-mutation-events-appending-text-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/forms/textarea-and-mutation-events-appending-text.html: Added.
* svg/custom/tref-nested-events-crash.svg:
- DOMCharacterDataModified shouldn't be fired in this case.
  Fixed to allow test to terminate without the event.
  Note that The event was fired by SVGShadowText, which is just an implentation detail and
  should not be exposed.
