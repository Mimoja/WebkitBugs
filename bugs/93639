Source/WebCore: ASSERT(!eventDispatchForbidden()) fires when removed plugin re-inserted as part of readyStateChange.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93639

Reviewed by Ryosuke Niwa.

Removing a plugin causes a detach which can cancel the last remaining load on a page,
resulting in a readyStateChange event during a time when things are inconsisent. Defer
the detach which triggers this chain of events until after the node is fully removed
from the document's elementsById map.
