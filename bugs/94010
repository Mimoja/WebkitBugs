REGRESSION(r125578): fast/regex/unicodeCaseInsensitive.html crash on Linux Debug Chromium
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94010

Reviewed by Tony Chang.

r125578 inspected the raw text run for word-end but the index it used to do so was for a normalized
version of the run that could be longer than the raw text run. So to allow proper detection of word-end
in complex text (i) do not normalize tabs to plain white-space and (ii) go back to using the normalized version
of the run for detecting word-end. There is a risk that some fonts may create glyphs for the '\t' character
but this does not turn up in any of our regression tests and the more common risk appears to be the new-line.

Test: fast/regex/unicodeCaseInsensitive.html
