Prevent reading stale data from InlineTextBoxes
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94750

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Text from dirty InlineTextBoxes should never be read or used. This change
enforces this design goal by forcefully zero-ing out the start and length
of InlineTextBoxes when they're being marked dirty. Ideally, we'd also
add asserts to the accessors for this data, but there are still several
places in editing that cause this. https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97264
tracks these cases.

This change involves making markDirty virtual. Running the line-layout
performance test as well as profiling resizing the html5 spec showed
negligable impact with this change.

No new tests as this doesn't change any proper behavior.
