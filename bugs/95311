[CSSRegions]Use RefPtr's instead of weak references on DOMNamedFlowCollection
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95311

Patch by Andrei Onea <onea@adobe.com> on 2012-09-12
Reviewed by Andreas Kling.

Source/WebCore:

Currently, DOMNamedFlowCollection holds a collection of raw pointers to WebKitNamedFlow.
This causes a crash when there is a JS instance of a NamedFlowCollection snapshot taken
before the NamedFlow is deleted, since the memory previously occupied by the NamedFlow
can be accessed. Because of this, we need to use RefPtr's for the snapshot, so that such
dangling references extend the lifetime of the NamedFlow objects.

Test: fast/regions/webkit-named-flow-collection-crash.html

* dom/DOMNamedFlowCollection.cpp:
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowCollection):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::item):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::namedItem):
(WebCore):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowHashFunctions::hash):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowHashFunctions::equal):
(DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowHashFunctions):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowHashTranslator::hash):
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::DOMNamedFlowHashTranslator::equal):
Create new internal ListHashSet for RefPtr<WebKitNamedFlow>.
* dom/DOMNamedFlowCollection.h:
(WebCore::DOMNamedFlowCollection::create):
(DOMNamedFlowCollection):
* dom/NamedFlowCollection.cpp:
(WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::createCSSOMSnapshot):
(WebCore):
(WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::NamedFlowHashFunctions::hash):
(WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::NamedFlowHashFunctions::equal):
(NamedFlowCollection::NamedFlowHashFunctions):
(WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::NamedFlowHashTranslator::hash):
(WebCore::NamedFlowCollection::NamedFlowHashTranslator::equal):
Move back the definitions for NamedFlowHashFunctions and NamedFlowHashTranslator
to the .cpp file.
* dom/NamedFlowCollection.h:
(NamedFlowCollection):

LayoutTests:

Added test for crash which occurs when there is a raw pointer to a NamedFlow
(in a NamedFlowCollection) which has been freed.

* fast/regions/webkit-named-flow-collection-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/regions/webkit-named-flow-collection-crash.html: Added.
