Crash in RenderTable::calcBorderEnd
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95487

Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

Source/WebCore:

r126590 opened the window for a race condition in RenderObjectChildList::removeChildNode.
This is caused because willBeRemovedFromTree should be strictly following by the actual removal
and wasn't.

This race condition was caused by clearSelection() being called just after willBeRemovedFromTree,
which forced a section's cells recalc and would re-add the soon-to-be-removed child, causing the
crash.

Test: fast/table/crash-clearSelection-collapsed-borders.html

* rendering/RenderObjectChildList.cpp:
(WebCore::RenderObjectChildList::removeChildNode):
Moved the clearSeletion call before willBeRemovedFromTree. Added a warning about running code
after willBeRemovedFromTree and before removing the child from the tree.

LayoutTests:

* fast/table/crash-clearSelection-collapsed-borders-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/table/crash-clearSelection-collapsed-borders.html: Added.
