[BlackBerry] InRegion scrollable area dangling pointers were accessed in UI thread
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96318

Patch by Jacky Jiang <zhajiang@rim.com>

PR: 204066
Dangling pointers were accessed in UI thread, as the actual InRegion
scrollable areas of WebKit side had been destroyed before that in
WebKit thread after UI thread set scrolling to false.
Notify the client side to clear InRegion scrollable areas before we
destroy them in WebKit side.
