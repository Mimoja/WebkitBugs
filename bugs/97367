Crash in WebCore::Document::fullScreenChangeDelayTimerFired
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97367

Patch by Jeremy Apthorp <jeremya@chromium.org> on 2012-09-21
Reviewed by Abhishek Arya.

The document could be destroyed during the processing of the
fullscreenchange event, if the document was destroyed as a result of
one of the dispatchEvent calls.

This bug isn't reliably reproducible, so no new tests.
