Crash in CachedResource::checkNotify due to -webkit-crossfade.
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98068

Reviewed by Nate Chapin.

Source/WebCore:

Make sure to not re-add the same client again for |m_cachedFromImage|
and |m_cachedToImage|. This would otherwise cause the CSSCrossfadeValue
client to not get removed from its cached image resource (when it is
going away).

Test: fast/images/crossfade-client-not-removed-crash.html

* css/CSSCrossfadeValue.cpp:
(WebCore::CSSCrossfadeValue::loadSubimages):

LayoutTests:

* fast/images/crossfade-client-not-removed-crash-expected.txt: Added.
* fast/images/crossfade-client-not-removed-crash.html: Added.
