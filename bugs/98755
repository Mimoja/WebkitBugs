SVGTextRunRenderingContext changes font data in the glyph page, but it shouldn't
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98755

Reviewed by Eric Seidel.

Source/WebCore:

The code in SVGTextRunRenderingContext::glyphDataForCharacter, when it
encounters an <altglyph> tag, immediately replaces the font data for a
glyph with font data for the primary font, presumably to meet the SVG
spec requirement: "If the references to alternate glyphs do not result
in successful identification of alternate glyphs to use, then the
character(s) that are inside of the ‘altGlyph’ element are rendered as
if the ‘altGlyph’ element were a ‘tspan’ element instead."

If the alt glyph is not then found we are in the case from the spec
and indeed we should use the primary font. However, we end up replacing the GlyphPage
entry for the character with primary font data, which we should not do
because the glyph page might be used in some place that does not have
the alt glyph tag.

Furthermore, this causes object lifetime problems for font data, because
in cases where the font data that is replaced is for the system fallback
font the GlyphPage will live forever with no knowldege that it contains
font data pointers into font data other that the system fallback. The
replaced font data may be deleted while the pointer lives on in the
system fallback page.

The fix is simply not to replace the font data in the page.

Test: svg/text/alt-glpyh-on-fallback-font-crash.html

* rendering/svg/SVGTextRunRenderingContext.cpp:
(WebCore::SVGTextRunRenderingContext::glyphDataForCharacter): Keep track of the original font data and put it back
in the glyph page when the method has finished.

LayoutTests:

New test case that includes an alt-glyph that comes from the system
fallback font (because the alt-glyph doesn't reference anything). This
test crashes on Chromium linux without the patch, and may crash on
other platforms too.

* svg/text/alt-glpyh-on-fallback-font-crash.html: Added.
